People are vaguely aware that the U.S. could theoretically run without a president at all, the system is too robust to not be able to absorb an incapable commander in chief for 4 years. People are also vaguely aware that another 4 years of Trump bring with them the real danger to break the system. The only question that everyone needs to answer for themselves is: do I want that, or do I not want that. Biden being senile doesn't change the equation either way.\n\nNow I'm not saying that being senile or incapable doesn't hurt your odds of winning. It does, because there is a significant amount of people who care about that. But they are not necessarily those who will decide this election.\n\n\"But it would still help to sway that particular group, wouldn't it?\"\n\nYes, it would. And the only way to do so is by having a canditate who has been campaigning for a year by now. The only thing you would achieve by haphazardly changing your candidate at the last possible moment is signaling the exact opposite of what your side is fighting for: Political stability.",

The only thing you would achieve by haphazardly changing your candidate at the last possible moment is signaling the exact opposite of what your side is fighting for: Political stability.\n\nOr it signals that you're taking the problem of democracy seriously by putting up a stronger candidate who could do the 24/7 press tours shitting on Trump. If people care about democracy, then they'll vote for any candidate willing to champion the cause.\n\nWe can come up with any story we want here. I'm not 100% sold on mine, but don't pretend yours is iron-clad either.",

And Joe Biden participated in **EVERY SINGLE ONE.**   I think part of the reason \"America's Combeack Kid\" was able to have his legendary Comeback, was cause he got up on the debate stage, and clawed that shit back. Here is a video of the Univision debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8-d2vyWn-A&amp;pp=ygUkam9lIGJpZGVuIHZzIGJlcm5pZSBzYW5kZXJzIHVuaXZpc29u](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8-d2vyWn-A&amp;pp=ygUkam9lIGJpZGVuIHZzIGJlcm5pZSBzYW5kZXJzIHVuaXZpc29u)\n\nI want to put this debate into context for people. The 2020 Democratic primary was one of the most policy focused debate circuits I've literally ever seen. Years of \"force the vote\" must have gotten everyone's minds into the idea that the candidate's policy proposals were going to transfer 1 to 1 into actual law, because it was a major focus of the campaign. For an example, I don't think there was a single debate where medicare for all was not interrogated by the moderators at length.\n\nThe debate you see above happened a the end of the debate cycle. Bernie Sanders knows he's probably going to lose unless he makes something big happen, so he's out for blood. It's also kind of an unsettling time, the pandemic was gripping the nation and Trump's disastrous response was proving just how high the stakes were. But not only did Joe show up to this debate, *he does well.*\n\nHe engages with Bernie on Policy. He doesn't just spew memorized facts either, he responds to what Bernie's saying in real time. If you pay attention, he still has his glitch moments (where he goes \"and-and-and\") but he finishes his sentences with coherent thoughts.\n\nThe Joe Biden of 2020 was able to participate in 11 debates that were incredibly heavy on the mental. For debating Trump, I genuinely believ the contrasts are so obvious some short slogans will probably do to get the point across, but in these primary debates you're fighting on a stage with 6 other people who are all reasonably smart and not Maga dipshits to prove you deserve to stand in the middle. He did that. THat's part of the reason why he is our nominee.\n\nNow if you've actually watched the video I linked and you watched the debate against Trump, even parts of it, you'll know the Joe of 2024 is not that Joe. I don't think he could debate Bernie like he did back then. I think a lot has changed and *even if we're sticking with him we need to acknowledge that.* We've got to grappled with the reality that Joe could easily get slammed again when he debates Trump in September.\n\nSo yeah, Joe had some bad debate nights in the dem primary. But nobody doubted that he was mentally fit enough to run, in part because he was active on the campaign trail, and did literally 10 other debates besides. If Joe is our nominee, he's got one shot to actually beat Trump on the debate stage again in septmber. I really fucking hope he has a good plan for how to do that.",

But if you're unable to support your general perception of someone with actual things they did fitting that perception, it means you most likely don't actually know where they come from and whether they're correct or not. For most intelligent people that would be the cue to check the origin of their opinion on someone.\n\nPeople with lives outside of Reddit don't typically feel the need to stress that in discussions. But sure, your time is definitely very precious and I should've been aware of that. Not quite precious enough to prevent you from whining like this but just precious enough for you not to give a single example when explicitly asked for one and broadly complaining instead.\n\nWhat do I think he was doing when he called UncivilLaw \"unamerican\" (which he didn't actually do btw, he called defending the SCOTUS ruling unamerican)? Hmmm, if only there was a way to know what I think happened there. If only there was a prior message where I used that exact example and explained why Pisco wasn't just hammering feelings over facts. Oh, there is? Did I actually pre-answer your question while you still haven't responded to most of my initial reply to you? Kinda interesting, don't you think?\n\nI'm glad to hear that you were aware that you weren't going to give any examples when replying. At the very least you're not that delusional. Tragically, that also means you responded to the one guy explicitly asking for an example fully intending not to give one.\nNot only did that make your entire response meaningless, proving the guy's point, but it also means you might have some other mental thing going on preventing you from engaging in meaningful conversations. Either that or you're a child. That would actually explain our entire exchange as well. And it would explain the \"grow up\" comments projecting your own insecurity about your age and / or mental faculty. Now I feel kinda bad for having bullied the troubled kid.",

For most intelligent people that would be the cue to check the origin of their opinion on someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People with lives outside of Reddit don&amp;#39;t typically feel the need to stress that in discussions. But sure, your time is definitely very precious and I should&amp;#39;ve been aware of that. Not quite precious enough to prevent you from whining like this but just precious enough for you not to give a single example when explicitly asked for one and broadly complaining instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do I think he was doing when he called UncivilLaw &amp;quot;unamerican&amp;quot; (which he didn&amp;#39;t actually do btw, he called defending the SCOTUS ruling unamerican)? Hmmm, if only there was a way to know what I think happened there. If only there was a prior message where I used that exact example and explained why Pisco wasn&amp;#39;t just hammering feelings over facts. Oh, there is? Did I actually pre-answer your question while you still haven&amp;#39;t responded to most of my initial reply to you? Kinda interesting, don&amp;#39;t you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad to hear that you were aware that you weren&amp;#39;t going to give any examples when replying. At the very least you&amp;#39;re not that delusional. Tragically, that also means you responded to the one guy explicitly asking for an example fully intending not to give one.\nNot only did that make your entire response meaningless, proving the guy&amp;#39;s point, but it also means you might have some other mental thing going on preventing you from engaging in meaningful conversations. Either that or you&amp;#39;re a child. That would actually explain our entire exchange as well. And it would explain the &amp;quot;grow up&amp;quot; comments projecting your own insecurity about your age and / or mental faculty. Now I feel kinda bad for having bullied the troubled kid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Wish he wouldn&amp;#39;t have talked shit after, but people do that when they&amp;#39;re upset, and talking with Pisco would leave anyone feeling upset.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "selftext": "#Welcome to the Destiny Sub patch: 0.7.01.20.24\n\n**Topline**: outrage porn out, screenshots of other subs out, evidence in, quality demands up, prison realm unsealed\n\n## Subreddit Rules:\n\n&gt;1) Don't post links or screenshots about other subreddits.\n\nDon't post links or screenshots of other subreddits. Even when censored it could be considered 'brigading' and I did not get an answer I was comfortable with to allow this on the sub, and these are typically low quality outrage bait in the first place. \n\n&gt;2) Respect Streamers and Guests\n\nCriticism is acceptable, understand there's a line between being critical, being unhinged, and being so unhinged that you have to be banned. There is no clear delineation, don't ask for one. Use your social skills.\n\n&gt;3) No Sexual Comments About Women\n\nNo one wants to know how horny a picture or video of a woman makes you. Insta-ban minimum 30 days.\n\n&gt;4) Attack arguments, not attributes\n\nAttack arguments. Accusations of \"bad faith\" and mind reading are an annoying waste of everyone's time. If they're bad faith then illustrate the contradictions in their arguments that would make that evident. This includes deploying the 'white woman' silencer on what would otherwise be garden variety misogyny. This includes vague gesturing toward bad faith like saying \"you can't criticize [x] here\" and then vanish when someone asks what criticisms you think you can't say.\n\n&gt;5) No Organized Harassment or Reporting\n\nThere *can* be an exception in the event of direct calls for violence or extreme violations of TOS, but that won't be added to the rules because everyone thinks their case is a special exception. \n\n&gt;6) Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\n\nThese are judgement calls. Basically, put some sort of direct evidence of what you're talking about to not risk removal or ban depending on the subject. This varies by how important the claims are, how readily available the evidence is, how charged a topic is. 10 second clips disconnected from the broader material, deceptive cropping, partially quoting, etc. are unacceptable. \n\n&gt;7) No outrage/engagement bait\n\nThe internet, AND ESPECIALLY TWITTER, is filled with people intentionally making you mad so you can post it elsewhere so other people also get mad. There are plenty of other subreddits dedicated to being mad about shit, so go post it there. \n\n&gt;8) Properly label content\n\nFlair things appropriately, primarily err on the side of labeling memes/edits/jokes as shitpost, real tweets as tweets, and actual fucking art ***NOT AI DOGSHIT*** as art. Lots of posts can overlap when it comes to politics/discussion/media and doesn't need attention. Especially for art the goal is to keep art from users like /u/canadianturt1e super visible since it usually takes an ungodly amount of time compared to posting a screenshot of AI slop.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nWith the recent mass unban of 27,094 redditors of varying levels of frontal lobe development there was a noticeable drop in the collective IQ of posts/comments here. Free_Speech_Norman_Rockwell.png is not a good vehicle for anything insightful or interesting, \"change my mind [inflammatory opinion without elaboration]\" is not a good vehicle for anything insightful or interesting... you get the point. \n\n**The goal of these rules is to explicitly push for higher quality posts over farming outrage.** \n\nAnd as always, the spirit of the law is more important than the letter. Whatever \"loophole\" exists in the means is disregarded if it undermines the ends.\n\n## Mechanics Updates:\n\n**The RobotDestiny will post upcoming events and will update the DGG offline/online post appropriately:**\n\n- [Preview](https://i.imgur.com/WFgyqh3.png)\n\n- there are still some control features left to implement, but this is basically good to go, but now is a good time to ask if there is additional information you want added to the offline/online posts and I can implement last minute, since I still have a bit of work left\n\n- this is meant to give you notice about important upcoming events that are live and easily add to your calendar; not every stream or every event\n\n- everyone has to learn this lesson eventually, but fuck anything to do with managing dates and times in software, holy fuck kill me \n\n**Mass reload:**\n\n- I'm rearming my entire paramilitary with 30 senile Biden Blasts to cope with the aforementioned free roaming inmates\n\n- The threshold for getting banned by yours truly is now substantially lower, and there is now an automated message with your ban that includes the comment/link that did you in. \n\n**Increased Podcast Support:**\n\n- Live Bridges episodes and Live Anything Else episodes will have their own posts dedicated to them automatically when their respective stream goes live\n\n- Will be integrating Patreon as a source of truth on podcast information and posts \n\n**Upcoming - Factions:**\n\nOne of the goofy things I liked about the neoliberal sub is being able to !ping various debate hebephile gangs as MMT'rs, Liberals, Hillary-stans, Friedmen etc. \n\nThis will have a similar implementation. You can opt to join into a faction - YEE/PEPE for example, and users can ping you to blast some dude, argue with some dude, or just for the lolz (abuse will be met with instant atomization).\n\n**Upcoming - DGG Sync:**\n\nOne of the most annoying aspects of the bullets system is that it's based on me manually awarding munitions. In the not so distant future you can sync your reddit account with an email verified  destiny.gg account and with your years of civil service (threshold to stop botting/etc.) your reddit account will automatically be awarded munitions on a quarterly (probably) basis, no dgg sub or moderator glazing required. (*excessive* abuse will be met with instant atomization)\n\nThis gives an avenue to nuke unacceptable behavior from a DGG member across all platforms and is a goofy award for being around a long time. Some ban immunity might come with this, going from 3 days to 1 day, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.\n\n**Upcoming - Friends of the Stream:** \n\nWhen Destiny is offline and other friends of the stream like Ryan McBeth or Lonerbox or [your personal favorite person here] are live there will be a list of various friends of the stream if they're currently streaming (probably confined to YouTube streams for the immediate future)\n\n---\n\nWe hope you are looking forward to the patch and future content on the destiny (the streamer) subreddit.\n\nPost your thoughts, opinions, and dreams in the comments.",

I don&amp;#39;t even know if that&amp;#39;s possible, but it feels weird to see people get banned by users without any counterargument or reasoning brought forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

No, well then it is still too late even more so and other candidates would be too risky to run, since something major could come up, well what if we find a super suitable candidate? No, Biden has won before over Trump and has a track record to show.\n\nI personally think Biden will lose against Trump as it stands now, but I'm curious if you think that Biden should stay as the presidential candidate what would change your mind on this?",

It is his job to put his country and party before himself and do what's best for both. If he had stepped aside and the DNC had ran a primary, we would likely have seen someone else emerge from the woodwork. Instead, he held onto power and is now threatening the very pillars upon which both his party and country stand. \n\nI am voting for Biden but I also am I human being with eyes and a brain. Around this time last in 2020, Biden was polling at 50%, he's at 40% right now. He was also polling at 40% in March 2024. He announced his candidacy in April 2023 and was at a 41% approval rating then. His unpopularity is not a recent event; we've all known for a long time that he's losing favor. I know everyone likes to tear up polls nowadays because of the disaster that was 2016 and the red wave that never came but these statistics are certainly cause for alarm. \n\nI have encouraged people to vote for Biden with all my soul but it's starting to feel like the writing's on the wall. I'm not even saying that he should necessarily step down now; it's likely too late and I'll ride with him and do my best to convince others to do so as well. However, it's not ridiculous to call the guy selfish for deciding to run for a second term. I don't think it's crazy to say that things wouldn't be quite as contentious if there was a younger, more articulate and exciting person representing the democratic party. \n\n[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2020/national/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2020/national/)\n\n[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/)\n\n[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/)",

It is his job to put his country and party before himself and do what&amp;#39;s best for both. If he had stepped aside and the DNC had ran a primary, we would likely have seen someone else emerge from the woodwork. Instead, he held onto power and is now threatening the very pillars upon which both his party and country stand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am voting for Biden but I also am I human being with eyes and a brain. Around this time last in 2020, Biden was polling at 50%, he&amp;#39;s at 40% right now. He was also polling at 40% in March 2024. He announced his candidacy in April 2023 and was at a 41% approval rating then. His unpopularity is not a recent event; we&amp;#39;ve all known for a long time that he&amp;#39;s losing favor. I know everyone likes to tear up polls nowadays because of the disaster that was 2016 and the red wave that never came but these statistics are certainly cause for alarm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have encouraged people to vote for Biden with all my soul but it&amp;#39;s starting to feel like the writing&amp;#39;s on the wall. I&amp;#39;m not even saying that he should necessarily step down now; it&amp;#39;s likely too late and I&amp;#39;ll ride with him and do my best to convince others to do so as well. However, it&amp;#39;s not ridiculous to call the guy selfish for deciding to run for a second term. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s crazy to say that things wouldn&amp;#39;t be quite as contentious if there was a younger, more articulate and exciting person representing the democratic party. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2020/national/\"&gt;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2020/national/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/\"&gt;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\"&gt;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
