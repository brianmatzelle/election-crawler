    "response": "Trump is clearly cognitively declining as well, just not nearly to the extent Biden is, so Biden's cognitive decline overshadows anything you can really say about Trump. Trump and Biden were both at the debate last Thursday, but only one of them was visibly senile.\n\nBasically any point you could make about Trump's cognitive decline can very easily be countered with, \"well yeah but Biden is like 10x worse\". It's not a horse you want to hitch your wagon to."

    "response": "All systems are a trade-off between local-representation, proportional representation, parliament size and \"government cohesion\".\n\nThe UK system values local representation, parliament size and government cohesion (it generally produces strong single party majorities) at the cost of proportional representation.\n\nA proportional systems values proportionality but has sacrifice local representation and government cohesion (they tend to produce coalition governments, many countries try to limit this effect by using vote thresholds to get into parliament however these inevitably reduce proportionality).\n\nThen you have mixed systems like in Germany (where you have two separate votes, one for a local representative and one for a party (where the second one governs the proportional makeup of the parliament), and in the end the parties that got a more seats then their local candidate secured fill their remaining seats with list candidates) that try to combine local representation with a proportional seat distribution, however this system can produce massive parliaments as there is no fixed number of MP\u2019s (Germany, with a population of 84 million, has the second highest number of MP\u2019s in the world after China) while still having the same cohesion issues as a purely proportional one.\n\nYou (as a society) just have to decide what characteristics you value the most, there unfortunately is no strictly best system."

They have outright already stated in plain text even if he's telling his AG to do shit outside of the authority of the President, the fact he's telling the AG to do it makes that whole conversation completely, absolutely, irrevocably immune. \n\nMost people haven't read the ruling, and are regurgitating other bad faith actors interpretation of the ruling."

    "response": "I think thats actually almost a good metaphor to simply describe the ruling.\n\nThe president has the core power to put things in a box, but its still a crime if he puts something illegal in the box. The ruling says that you can't even start a trial about the president putting something in the box, illegal or no, since its an official act, and allowing litigation could impact the president's ability to put things in the box in the future. So, even if you know something illegal is in the box, if you want to prosecute the president for it, you have to demonstrate the thing inside the box is illegal without ever being able to open the box, nor using evidence showing the president putting the illegal thing in the box. Doesn't matter if the president bragged to the press about stashing 40 bricks of cocaine in the box, and the box is covered in coke, you aren't allowed to open it.\n\nI think that's probably a better hypothetical for normal people and people on stream, rather than \"WHAT IF TRUMP DIRECTED SEAL TEAM 6 AND THE DOJ TO RAPE NANCY PELOSI\"."

For Biden staying in the race, it seems that the arguments he has are the following:\n\n* Incumbent advantage\n* Biden has won over Trump before\n* Biden has a track record to show\n* Biden is somewhat the generic democrat (i.e. he should do better than Trump)\n* Other candidates could have skeletons in the closet\n* Polling is irrelevant to the actual outcome of an election (more or less)\n* Debate performance is irrelevant to the actual outcome of an election (more or less)\n* People have short term memory and will probably forget in 2-3 weeks and that polling would show that\n* There is only a few months to the election so there isn't time to find a proper candidate\n\nWith all these arguments listed out it seems that with polling showing an approval rating of 0% he would still in *theory* support Biden as the candidate so what is the actual thing that could change Destinys mind on this?\n\nIf polling is still down in 2-3 weeks does he then change his mind? No, well then it is still too late even more so and other candidates would be too risky to run, since something major could come up, well what if we find a super suitable candidate? No, Biden has won before over Trump and has a track record to show.\n\nI personally think Biden will lose against Trump as it stands now, but I'm curious if you think that Biden should stay as the presidential candidate what would change your mind on this?",
    "response": "Currently there are few things that would change my mind on removing Biden. Obviously if he steps down and endorses someone else. Second if substantial evidence comes out that he\u2019s cooked (beyond simply being old). Or, if the Democratic Party agrees to all support an alternative choice."

    "response": "I would need significant and clear polling that the vast majority of the dems would be excited by a specific replacement. The nominee would have to clearly beat Biden around the nation. People cry replace but have no evidence that people would turn out for anyone else. Pointing out a problem with zero thought of a solution is typically brain dead behavior in my eyes."

    "response": "The one thing everyone who theory crafts a different candidate forgets is that the replacement has to actually want to run. Sure throw up Beshear, Newsom, Whitmer. What if they don\u2019t want to run under these conditions? What if Harris doesn\u2019t want to run against trump right now?

Replacing Biden for her removes focus back onto Trump.

When you live on the edge of panic in fear of failure it's really easy to turn everything into a dilemma, and even the smallest nudges of bad faith turn ripples into waves.\n\nThe modern right suffers no such foolishness, as they live in a sort of incoherent superposition of these things, everything is always the worst and the greatest at the same time,  have everything but believe they've lost everything, terrified of everyone but supremely certain they'd have the upper hand in any conflict, every radical plan or event (or crime really) is just too over the top to be believable and after it happens it was always inevitable, their candidate is the worst because \"someone needs to be\" and the greatest because he is. There's nowhere for their eyes to turn, and anyone who would suggest otherwise is deranged."

Polling of existing dems who claim he's too old...if he then goes on to run and lose, yeah you can say I told you so. The evidence of his disadvantage is clear.\n\nThe first thing I said after that debate ended was this was going to continue as a pattern and that every time Biden speaks he's probably just going to continue to show his decline. And not much later he's publicly speaking about how he's going to beat Trump in 2020. I mean...the evidence is clear."
