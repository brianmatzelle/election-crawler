I thought conservative justices were supposed to have principles, not just playing living text for the other team. I'll be the first to say Roe vs. Wade was absolute bullshit, this is an invention on the same scale. Nobody thought that presidents were immune to prosecution before this.\n\nAm I in fear for our democracy? There was a fucking attempted coup. That's just an accepted truth now, Trump's defense isn't contesting that part, they're just saying it's not illegal because he was the president and the president should be above the law. Why are you not in fear for your democracy?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah I knew the clip was from Destiny before I looked at it\n\nShapiro clearly says in the episode (many times) that the presumptive immunity test is for whether it would impede the constitutional functions of further Presidents\n\nI mean yeah, his statement around seal team six and stuff was too vague, but watch the episode. You would agree with his take, not just Destiny\u2019s","role":"assistant"},{"content":"He misrepresents the presumptive immunity test horribly.\n\nWhen he first goes through the [Just Security flowchart](https:\/\/www.justsecurity.org\/95636\/supreme-court-presidential-immunity\/) at the [start of the episode](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OJYsGFV7eB4?t=595), he gives the example of Trump telling Pence to overturn the election as something where presumptive immunity would apply. Talking to the vice president is something the president could be expected to do, but it is not written explicitly in the constitution etc. and that means presumptive immunity applies.\n\nHere's the quote: \"the president very often has conversations with the vice president about a wide variety of topics that in and of itself is in fact official conduct **but he's pushing the vice president to do a thing that is plainly not inside the Constitutional structure** and not only that if you prosecute the president for that is that going to impede the functioning of the president on a go forward basis\"\n\nThe bolded part in my understanding is basically 100% added by Ben, and the part after that which he makes sound like an afterthought or an addendum \"if you prosecute is that going to impede the functioning of the president on a go forward basis,\" that's the actual test.\n\nIf the test included provisions for the protection of some sort of constitutional order it would be much more like the moderate ruling Ben Shapiro wishes it was, but he wrote that in. If the ruling was basically: \"The president has some immunity from prosecution unless it's *really really* bad,\" then that would be more reasonable, but that's not actually what's there.\n\nSimilarly, when he talks about [Seal Team 6](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OJYsGFV7eB4?t=1172) he says \"the president ordering them to do something blatantly illegal like murder his political opponent prosecution of that crime would certainly overcome any presumptive immunity,\" but it being blatantly illegal does not factor into the presumptive test at all, and it definitely explicitly does not factor into whether or not something is an official act in the first place.\n\nAgain, Ben is rewriting this decision to seem like: \"You have presidential immunity, unless it's something really bad.\"\n\nAlso is it really obvious that the Seal Team 6 example is not immune under this ruling? I can't see how being the commander in chief and commanding the military does not fall under absolute immunity, given the example was commanding the DOJ illegally. And even if it does, the test is whether or not prosecuting this will impact pose any danger to the authority or powers of the executive branch. It's a pretty damn broad test.","role":"user"},{"content":"Even if the Seal Team 6 technically doesn't fall outside of the scope of presumptive immunity, you're forgetting the key word, presumptive.

The curriculum\u2019s goal is to establish a \u201cnew regime of countergenocide and counterhegemony,\u201d ridding America of white Christian culture. Primary and secondary students are made to clap and chant to Aztec gods of cannibalism and human sacrifice for \u201cliberation, transformation, and decolonization.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt;* Seattle Public Schools train teachers that the education system commits \u201cspirit murder\u201d against black kids \u2014 \u201cmurder[ing] the souls of black children every day through systemic, institutionalized, anti-black, state-sanctioned violence.\u201d In recent training sessions, white teachers were told they needed to \u201cbankrupt [their privilege] in acknowledgment of [their] thieved inheritance.\u201d\n\nQuoting https:\/\/www.thecollegefix.com\/yes-crt-is-taught-in-k-12-schools-heres-how\/ :\n\n&gt;* In California, the Board of Education has approved the nation\u2019s first statewide ethnic studies curriculum to teach public high school students about the oppression of people of color.\n&gt;\n&gt;* The Oregon Department of Education is training its K-12 teachers in \u201cmath equity\u201d to combat \u201cthe toxic characteristics of white supremacy culture with respect to math.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;* An elementary school in Philadelphia \u201cforced fifth-grade students to celebrate \u2018black communism\u2019 and simulate a Black Power rally in honor of political radical Angela Davis.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;* Last fall, one Virginia school district spent $24,000 on Ibram Kendi books pushed as \u201crequired reading\u201d for U.S. history classes.\n&gt;* A high school in Minnesota now begins all of its staff meetings with a commitment to dismantling \u201cprocesses that benefit whiteness.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;* In September, a high school in Washington canceled a 9\/11 tribute because it could be seen as \u201cracially insensitive.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;* As of July 2020, a reported 4,500 schools across the nation have embedded the controversial New York Times 1619 Project curriculum into their classrooms.","role":"user"},{"content":"Is the problem race consciousness then?\n\nI don't understand why people being aware of the historical and current implications of their race in society is a problem?","role":"assistant"},{"content":"The problem is that the children are being indoctrinated to think of themselves and other people as possessing an inescapable racial identity and to think of themselves not as individuals but as members of collective racial groups.  \n\nThey are being taught to have a racist mindset and racist worldview.

Swalwells 5-minutes were clearly intended to discredit Ben (he even had a poster lol), but Ben hadokened him into the Stone Age before he could get shots off; and by the time he got to the poster he was already dead.\n\nThen the chair followed up after swalwell fucked up his closing zinger with \u201cyou forgot the first rule of holes; when you\u2019re in one, stop digging\u201d lol.\n\nThe dems never asked Ben a single question after this exchange for the rest of the session.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"The poster was so clumsy.  He didn't have it set up at the right time.  Then it sat behind him for too long.  Then, when he finally circled back to it, too much time had passed since the initial question about homosexuality as a sin.  Then he brought it up by saying, \"I have the receipts\" because that was a pre-planned line (I assume), but it made no sense as a gotcha because Ben had already reiterated his position in agreement with the poster quote.\n\nSwalwell had it all planned out but had no plan to improvise or adjust once it started going bad.  Ben had to answer exactly how Swalwell wanted, or it wouldn't work.\n\nIt reminds me of Louie CK's \"how do you like them apples\"\/Goodwill Hunting joke.","role":"user"},{"content":"Swalwell is such a joke of a politician.

The heritage foundation is a pretty large organization, and some of the proposals in there are a good representation of the rights move away from the center.\n2. Under the guise of small government, the idea to remove and replace a lot of existing civil servants with political actors is unsettling. A significant majority of these people are experts in bridges, ecology, urban planning, and more. They're not political actors, and the attempt to politicize these roles is not in the interest of people or communities.\n3. The idea of \"ending the war on oil\" is just against human interest. Considering we're looking at seeing oil shortages before the turn of the century (probably at the end of a lot of our lifetimes), not investing in identifying a more sustainable energy source now seems mostly like a way to pay out their sponsors than to actually help people.\n4. Attacks on woke propaganda in schools is either (A) just a witch hunt or (B) an attempt to overrule state level education systems.\n\nOverall, it's a confirmation that neither party is a party of small government, and every politician wants to expand the state because it is in all their interest to do so.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"I like the part where WOKe ideology is out of schools, and anyone who think CHILDREN should learn about sex changes and cutting your private parts off are evil people .","role":"user"},{"content":"Okay but what about children learning about how their gender affects them in the world?\n\nShould girls not learn about the fact that up until very recently, historically speaking, their gender prevented them from voting?\n\nMost of these bills do more to prevent very basic discussions on gender than to prevent the boogie man of gender transitions.","role":"assistant"}]}
