At 32, I\u2019d joined the 12 percent of Americans who report serious difficulty with stairs. On bad days, I became a prisoner in my own home.\n\n&gt;A few months later, visiting Bucharest, I rode the elevator in my mother\u2019s five-story building. A developer in a much poorer Eastern European country could afford to include an elevator, but the developer of my luxury five-story building in Brooklyn, built 25 years after the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, could not? I quit my job in real estate and started a nonprofit focused on building codes and construction policy.\n\n&gt;Through my research on elevators, I got a glimpse into why so little new housing is built in America and why what is built is often of such low quality and at high cost. The problem with elevators is a microcosm of the challenges of the broader construction industry \u2014 from labor to building codes to a sheer lack of political will. These challenges are at the root of a mounting housing crisis that has spread to nearly every part of the country and is damaging our economic productivity and our environment.\n\n&gt;\u2026Similar themes explain everything from our stalled high-speed rail development to why it\u2019s so hard to find someone to fix a toilet or shower.

I quit my job in real estate and started a nonprofit focused on building codes and construction policy.\n\n&gt;Through my research on elevators, I got a glimpse into why so little new housing is built in America and why what is built is often of such low quality and at high cost. The problem with elevators is a microcosm of the challenges of the broader construction industry \u2014 from labor to building codes to a sheer lack of political will. These challenges are at the root of a mounting housing crisis that has spread to nearly every part of the country and is damaging our economic productivity and our environment.\n\n&gt;\u2026Similar themes explain everything from our stalled high-speed rail development to why it\u2019s so hard to find someone to fix a toilet or shower.

One of the reasons housing costs have gone up is that people with ridiculously low pandemic era interest rates are not selling their homes because they don't want to lose their interest rates. This keeps the supply short which increases costs. Lowering the interest rates might actually cause more houses to go on the market which might mean a better situation for buyers. \n\nAlso unemployment went up despite jobs being added...because more people are looking for work, not because there are more unemployed people. Unemployment is based on how many people are looking for work but can't find it.\n\nThe real reason the fed should consider lowering the rate though is real wage gains have slowed and inflation seems to be trending downward. This implies that if rates were lowered it might boost the economy but not so much that inflation goes up again. There I essentially room for a rate cut that doesn't damage the economy.","role":"user"},{"content":"That probably won't help much.

It is a small country, after all. \nPeople who are being hired to maintain the train, drive, bring in enjoyment ( dancers), etc... are all from Laos. \n\nIt might be different, though, if the rail income also have Chinese stake in there.\n\nEdit : For people who keeps on insisting that I am beautifying the current situation. \n\n Laos has close to 11 billions in external debts with over half of it to China. They deferred in payments last year and even then China said nothing. They are actually allowing them to deferred in payments ( don't know if it will be good or bad in long term ). \n\nThese externals debts is due to railways contractions, dam construction and roadway construction. For anyone who knows finance and economics, these are positive things that propel\/ boost an economy. \n\nIt allows one to reach different markets. \n\nLaos has a huge irrigation problem when it comes to agriculture since they mainly produce rice which takes water. These dams being built are more than welcome. \n\nAnd also the biggest importer of rice is China. As everyone knows China imports a lot of food due to their huge population. If Laos can produce surplus, they can sell to China and other market. \nEven faster now with all these routes and railways. \n\nOnly long term cooperation can tell us whether or not it will be good or bad for the country. \nI personally do not know.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"I don\u2019t know all the details, but Chinese tourist spending doesn\u2019t actually benefit the local economy as much as you believe.
