Not just the numbers, but where they come from, and what the strengths and weaknesses of various sources are. Get to know the difference between jobs estimates from the CES, CPS, and QCEW. Differences between median income for individuals households and families, and how incomes vary with age. Relationships between labor force, population, and age. Knowing recent trends in survey response rates and how those are impacting reliability in a lot of data sources. What has been driving CPI and the lags of various components (especially on the shelter side).\n\nMostly though the biggest thing is to be curious about data. I come from finance background and just as the most important aspect of financial analysis is getting deep into the MDA and notes to the financial statements the most important part in economics is being interested in going deep in descriptions of data sources and how they are derived. If you don\u2019t know the strengths and weaknesses in your data you may as well be flying blind.\n\nOnce you understand the data the even more important (and arguably more difficult) skill is being able to take all the complex stories and nuance you discover learning the data and distill it into stories that are easily understandable and digestible to your target audience. One of the most fun and satisfying aspects of economics is at the of the day everything learn should be grounded in the real world - often in concepts that at their core are actually pretty simple and relatable to the experiences of most people. Being able to make and describe those connections is the real magic of the discipline and the profession.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"That's really helpful thank you. I don't really want to be an economist (I don't really see a career path in it lol) but I've always liked that, sort of like engineering, it's very grounded in data (don't at me, bros, I'm not talking about economic theories like the myth of the rational man).\u00a0\n\n\nBut engineering is grounded at the root in physics and math, for which the data are very solid. How do you go about grading the data sources, especially over time?

Often it isn\u2019t throw it out so much as \u201ctake it with a grain of salt\u201d. This is usually more the case with higher frequency data (things that come out monthly or quarterly), and so depending on the dataset it might have annual revisions or you might use something more robust for the long term. Ultimately the answer - as is often the case in economics - is \u201cit depends\u201d.\n\nTo your other bigger picture points - what\u2019s fun about economics is it\u2019s grounded in a lot of data (and in academic economics a lot of theory), and it\u2019s pretty versatile. Studying it I think is a great option for learning how to think and tell stories with data - which is really what I see as the core of my job. A big part of learning economics for me was learning statistics and applying that idea of randomness and understanding that data isn\u2019t perfect but that you can piece it together to create a picture. I also have a humanities background (undergrad ethics history and public policy) but always loved math\/finance and got a masters in economics because I liked both the math driven theory and the applied modeling. I do think it\u2019s discipline that is well suited to a lot of careers.","role":"assistant"}]}

The humorous, perhaps unintended consequence of the overtuning of Cheveron is that it's now going to make it more likely that businesses throughout the US face a patchwork of regulations across states, localities, counties, municipalities.\n\nTo be blunt, the problem with relying on think tank guys at places like Heritage to come up with policy recommendations is that those guys have never had to try and do business in the US.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"I think this is the biggest issue In North America vs europe, we are so rich but everything is expensive to build because regulations aren\u2019t standard across states.","role":"user"},{"content":"If regulations could be standard in each state that would be great.

China wants to do this with EVs, they have much stronger incentives to do so than America or Europe do. China has much worse congestion\/pollution and also their existing gas auto industry isn't that big\/important a part of their economy compared to the US and EU.\n\nWhereas in the US and EU the smog isn't a factor in the same way, and subsidizing EVs like this would cause tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in losses at automakers in the short term. You can still say it would be worth it, I even kind of agree, but the point is that there's reasons this kind of supply side subsidy is less politically possible in the US and EU.\n\nSo if a foreign country wants to subsidize and you don't want to take that route to match them, for whatever reasons, then tariffs are the best solution.\n\nSure it might be better for America and Europe if China just didn't subsidize in the first place and we didn't have to do tariffs, in that sense sure, tariffs are bad, if you want to look at it that way.\n\nBut who the hell are we to tell people in Beijing they have to keep driving gas cars and breathing suffocating smog every day just to make OUR economy slightly stronger?\n\nIt makes sense for China to subsidize their EV industry and it makes sense for the US and the EU to put up tariffs. Nobody has to think that this is a bad thing or must inevitably devolve into a trade war or whatever. It's a particular industry that they're subsidizing for particular reasons that make perfect sense, there is no problem.","role":"user"},{"content":"That is a totally valid perspective. \u00a0Another take is that by doing that China is using the US market (to the benefit of the consumer and deficit of labor and the US\/EU auto industries) to subsidize and partially pay for their EV transition.\n\nBut, as the global reserve currency (and the Euro is a second behind that) the US is expected, and needs to export dollars which means importing stuff (or running a capital account deficit but that isn\u2019t politically feasible).\n\nAmerican consumerism and king dollar rising developing countries up was part of the reason for the globalization push.\n\nThe cost portion of the cost\/benefit for the US laborer and customer has come into question though. \u00a0Or at least has made for good stump speeches and campaigning. \u00a0Or some combination.\n\nInteresting discussions.

The stairs to my third-floor Brooklyn walk-up apartment would leave me dizzy and winded, my ears ringing, heart beating out of my chest. At 32, I\u2019d joined the 12 percent of Americans who report serious difficulty with stairs. On bad days, I became a prisoner in my own home.\n\n&gt;A few months later, visiting Bucharest, I rode the elevator in my mother\u2019s five-story building. A developer in a much poorer Eastern European country could afford to include an elevator, but the developer of my luxury five-story building in Brooklyn, built 25 years after the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, could not? I quit my job in real estate and started a nonprofit focused on building codes and construction policy.\n\n&gt;Through my research on elevators, I got a glimpse into why so little new housing is built in America and why what is built is often of such low quality and at high cost. The problem with elevators is a microcosm of the challenges of the broader construction industry \u2014 from labor to building codes to a sheer lack of political will. These challenges are at the root of a mounting housing crisis that has spread to nearly every part of the country and is damaging our economic productivity and our environment.\n\n&gt;\u2026Similar themes explain everything from our stalled high-speed rail development to why it\u2019s so hard to find someone to fix a toilet or shower.

While the textbook definition is clear, and real-world examples are hard to find, it is far easier to find the textbook definition of other forms of market, such as in the real-world.*\n\n*However, even though neoclassical economics defines a competitive market as having many buyers and many sellers, none of which have any price setting power, in Australia, industries such as banking and airlines that clearly have \u2018few\u2019 suppliers with clear market power are widely referred to as \u2018competitive\u2019.*\n\n*To be clear, while such descriptions are solely based on the political power of these industries, and the fear of offending such industries, in a genuinely competitive market no supplier would have enough power (market or political) to exert such influence over the way they are described.*\n\n*In a well-functioning democracy, describing a market as an oligopoly should be as uncontroversial as describing subsidies for products with negative externalities, such as fossil fuels and large four-wheel drive vehicles, as \u2018inefficient\u2019. Needless to say, Australia is not such a democracy.*\n\n*Consider, for example, that the CEO of the Australian Bankers Association recently claimed that the Australian banking sector is \u201ca very competitive market\u201d.^18*\n\n*The Australian market is dominated by the \u2018Big 4\u2019 banks which have a combined market share of over three quarters of the market,^19 and rarely diverge significantly in their price offerings. They also make very large profits.^20*\n\n*Competition between the banks is largely concerned with advertising that emphasises brand image and other marketing initiatives.*\n\n*[...] Advertising does have a role in providing information in imperfect markets (as perfectly competitive markets are based on the assumptions that consumers already have perfect information and that all products in the market have identical features).*\n\n*That said, the fact that the \u2018Big 4\u2019 banks regularly collectively spend more than $1 billion per year on advertising is further proof that the Australian banking industry cannot meaningfully be described as \u2018competitive\u2019.^21*","role":"user"},{"content":"A common confusion here but it is incorrect to assert blankly that competition means X number of firms, and at least Y of them have to be below size X (which frankly the pdf you have linked above comes dangerously close to).

So long the government doesn't restrict access to a market (so long as you have free competition) then the market is competitive, regardless of how many firms there are.\n\n  \nThat's not to say that Australia's banks are or are not a competitive market. Four players alone doesn't really mean anything. Obviously, there are some licensure restrictions in place, so no one can argue this (the banking sector) is some sort of unregulated free market.

If we stopped new production of fossil fuels, any administration would be voted out of office and congress would swing to a supermajority. It would do irreversible damage to the economy. Everyone would become unemployed.\n\nThink of it like this: Say you need 1 gallon of gas to get to work. Government policy causes production to reduce 10% to 0.9 gallons for that same original supply. How much would you be willing to pay to get to work and back home? Gasoline is one of the most inelastic goods in human history. Virtually, the entire freight industry runs on fossil fuels. Packages, food, clothing, and anything that you go to the store for is transported by truck for your convenience. How much would that simple 10% loss in total daily supply affect the economy? \n\nIn the late 70s, the oil cartel OPEC reduced production of fossil fuels for oligarchic reasons of profit. There were gas lines down blocks of streets. Diesel and gasoline were selling out completely from gas stations all across the country. Prices exploded as governments tried to find solutions. We won\u2019t be off petroleum for many decades to come.\n\nUnfortunately, the United States population will continue to expand in the meantime until such time we have an alternative propulsion to drive motors in enough vehicles to impact the demand for gas and diesel.

Robber barons 2.0\u2026\n\nRust belt grew, drug addiction skyrocketed, prison industry exploded, wealth inequality eroded the middle class, blue collar jobs disappeared and everybody sent their kid to college, and everyone and their mom started working 50+ hour weeks in order to afford food and housing.

Close enough. \n\n&gt;The US government has $35 trillion of debt It's in more debt than the amount produced in the US in an entire year\n\nYes, that's true. But it's not something that's suddenly happened, the last time the GDP was greater than the debt was 2015 (not even for the entire year) before that was 2013. \n\n&gt;The debt isn't meant to be paid back because it CANT be paid back \n\nThis is just false. The debt will be paid back and historically the U.S. has an impeccable track record of paying it's debts. It's actually because they're so good at paying it back that they're able to keep increasing the debt. If they defaulted, who would loan them money going forward? \n\n&gt;The US government will default on its debt by devaluing\n\nNot at all. Also what? How would they even devalue their debt? \n\n&gt;The biggest losers here will be anyone holding this debt \n\nNah, they'll all get paid back because again, the US is a very good debtor. \n\n&gt;Who holds the majority of this debt? US citizens\n\nYeah, that's true. But that's because it's such a safe investment to make and has a guaranteed return. US Gov bonds are one of the safest investments you can possibly make. \n\nThere's good debt and bad debt. It's not like the U.S. has a big credit card and a shopping addiction. They are using all of this money to further the country in one way or another like roads, infrastructure, post office, welfare programs, national defense, food inspections, you know things governments provide its citizens to keep the wheels turning.\n\n Is there unnecessary spending? Yeah, probably. \n\nDoes it matter if it's greater than the GDP? Not necessarily. To put it a simpler way, if I have 300k in debt between a mortgage, student loans, and a car but I only make $80k a year, am I at risk of defaulting? Not necessarily, because that $300k isn't due in a year, it's spread out and due over time. I use the car to go to work, it helps me generate income to pay my loans back over time. For the government, building roads helps citizens get around, which allows them to work, spend, travel which generates tax, aka income for the government which enables them to pay back their debt over time.","role":"user"},{"content":"&gt; Does it matter if it's greater than the GDP?

Sure, having too much deficit spending can be harmful; but having deficit spending is not inherently bad. We'd be facing astronomically higher taxation with the same quality of services if we were to try to completely balance the budget.\n\nThis isn't to say there isn't a problem with spending; there absolutely is, and a lot of it is because of the fact that we subsidize a lot of things we really shouldn't; but it's kinda foolish to be so angry over deficit spending once you actually get into how it works and how it benefits us.","role":"assistant"}]}

Close enough. \n\n&gt;The US government has $35 trillion of debt It's in more debt than the amount produced in the US in an entire year\n\nYes, that's true.

Yeah, probably. \n\nDoes it matter if it's greater than the GDP? Not necessarily. To put it a simpler way, if I have 300k in debt between a mortgage, student loans, and a car but I only make $80k a year, am I at risk of defaulting? Not necessarily, because that $300k isn't due in a year, it's spread out and due over time. I use the car to go to work, it helps me generate income to pay my loans back over time.

The stairs to my third-floor Brooklyn walk-up apartment would leave me dizzy and winded, my ears ringing, heart beating out of my chest. At 32, I\u2019d joined the 12 percent of Americans who report serious difficulty with stairs. On bad days, I became a prisoner in my own home.\n\n&gt;A few months later, visiting Bucharest, I rode the elevator in my mother\u2019s five-story building. A developer in a much poorer Eastern European country could afford to include an elevator, but the developer of my luxury five-story building in Brooklyn, built 25 years after the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, could not? I quit my job in real estate and started a nonprofit focused on building codes and construction policy.\n\n&gt;Through my research on elevators, I got a glimpse into why so little new housing is built in America and why what is built is often of such low quality and at high cost. The problem with elevators is a microcosm of the challenges of the broader construction industry \u2014 from labor to building codes to a sheer lack of political will. These challenges are at the root of a mounting housing crisis that has spread to nearly every part of the country and is damaging our economic productivity and our environment.\n\n&gt;\u2026Similar themes explain everything from our stalled high-speed rail development to why it\u2019s so hard to find someone to fix a toilet or shower.

I'll walk you through this argument's failures....\n\nCertified material (like this titanium) had two types of tests being done to them prior to delivery. The first is a chemical analysis.  This chemical analysis (typically spectroscopy) will determine chemical analysis. The second type of analysis done is physical testing (hardness testing, tensile strength testing, etc) are done to ensure that the proper heating and cooling occurred that give the metals the proper physical characteristics for the usage intended. \n\nWhere I've not yet read is what is suspect, the chemical or physical analysis of the material. Without regard to what was failing, it is ultimately the responsibility of the purchasing group to verify if the material is being sent from a qualified source. I'm guessing that this work was done (Purchasing 101 stuff here).  \n\nWhen that is completed and assured, the material specifications sent from the supplier (material certs) are often taken at face value as the physical tests can not be reproduced at the end user's facilities. The chemical analysis can be done on a limited basis with XRF technology (X-Ray Florescent spectrometry) to verify the chemical analysis coming from the supplier, but that's limited to heavier elements in the periodic table above carbon. \n\nAs manufacturing QA, we rely heavily on that information being correct and true. A failure at that level is truly a failure that undermines a very basic and necessary trust and verification of industrial practices. Kudos to the QA team who caught it, but holy shit, this is a massive failure on the manufacturing of the metals. \n\nNow, why is this racist? The opinion that these folks are \"scrappers\" undercuts the metallurgical know-how in these countries, which is significant. We have a bad actor, not a bad culture. They could, from a metallurgical standpoint, melt down bicycle frames, and as long as the chemical and physical properties are correct, it will work just fine. Titanium is a metallurgical beast, though. There isn't much room for error with that material and its physical properties.","role":"assistant"}]}

The sensors and communications and memory and logic chips for drones and missiles are going to be a step behind, up against a ceiling until the Chinese companies figure out EUV and the other critical processes.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"The military most definitely is not using cutting edge chips. The US military is using 28nm at most, and even that is a generous estimate. The curb on export of cutting edge chips is solely to undermine their AI effort, as some advisors believe AGI is feasible with current approach, which if true (looking very unlikely) would grant the party that first acquires it an incredible advantage.\n\nHowever, if China does manage to dominate the mature chips market, which is a very profitable one, they are going to severely impact the profits of non-Chinese companies and therefore their available fund for cutting edge R&amp;D.","role":"user"},{"content":"&gt; The military most definitely is not using cutting edge chips.\n\nI'm fairly certain that the US military has *huge* cloud contracts that make use of data centers that use cutting edge chips, processing things from the mundane (weather models) to the more complicated (heavy analytics on intelligence gathering, sensor data all over, probably spy shit going down), to probably some bleeding edge research on things like AI, robotics, air and space platforms, etc. \n\nAlso, generations and generations of weapons, sensors, surveillance platforms, communications platforms, etc., keep getting changed out and upgraded. Do we really believe that the intelligence community doesn't have the ability to intercept any type of radio signal out there? And if modern radio communications (the latest generations of mobile data or even wifi), or fiber\/cable lines, use complex signals processing equipment, why wouldn't we assume that militaries have their own, and the ability to intercept and process others' signals?\n\nThe military keeps buying new stuff. Each generation will use the latest semiconductors available for that generation of stuff. And maybe that lags behind civilian\/commercial applications, where something that goes live in 2024 actually was developed using tech that was proven in 2019, or whatever, but the point is that it's always updating. \n\nIn other words, you can look at their 2024 tech and say \"well they're using stuff between 5-50 years old,\" and you'd be right. But they're still developing stuff today to be used as a 5-year-old tech in 5 years. Choking off a supply chain sets an adversary behind.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"When it comes to cutting edge chips the US most definitely is not developing the most advanced weapons with them, because the US cannot produce them itself. Can you imagine the US relying on TSMC for its 3nm chips for its fighter jets and on the first day of war those plants get bombed by China? Not going to happen. Not to mention they are simply an incredible waste to be put on weapons. The main benefit of these cutting edge nodes is that they take less space and use less power. That is why they are used on smartphones and almost nowhere else. You don't need to optimize chips for less space and less power if you are going to put them on planes or missiles \u2014 that is just dumb and a waste of resources.\n\nAs for Nvidia chips under restrictions, you don't need cutting edge nodes for those and China already has their replacement: Huawei Ascend. They already have chips comparable to A100. There is also no evidence China is behind on AI for military. At most you could say they are maybe behind on LLMs (even that is uncertain \u2014\u00a0see various LLM tests and rankings) and it's yet unclear what kind of applications they are going to have for the military. In other AI fields especially robotics China might have the lead.","role":"user"},{"content":"&gt; The main benefit of these cutting edge nodes is that they take less space and use less power. That is why they are used on smartphones and almost nowhere else.\n\nThat's just not true, though. Data centers are filled with specialized logic chips (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, other specialized silicon for video encoding or specialized processing requirements), and they're always upgrading to the latest and greatest. Standalone memory and storage chips also benefit from being on the latest and greatest nodes, too.\n\nAnd sometimes they don't rely on a bunch of commercial off the shelf stuff strung together in data centers, either. Sometimes they commission supercomputers for specific purposes. The U.S. military is a pretty significant customer of supercomputers, and those are going to have all the processing cores that take advantage of the most recent process nodes, at least as of the time it was manufactured. And the U.S. Department of Energy, although not the military itself, tends to own\/use supercomputers for nuclear weapons research.\n\nSo looking it up, the top 500 supercomputer list has [Frontier](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frontier_\\(supercomputer\\)) at #1, which uses AMD Epyc 7713 CPUs. That's a server chip from TSMC's 7nm node, designed to use 225W. This computer uses 9472 of them. Then, for GPUs, it uses 37,888 Instinct MI250X GPUs, from TSMC's 6nm node, designed to use 500W of power. By my count, that's 2.1 megawatts for the CPUs, 18.9 megawatts for the GPUs. Plus whatever the memory, storage, cooling, and all the other stuff is going to be using. That computer is drawing enough electricity to power a small city at that point, for logic chips manufactured on relatively recent nodes.\n\nMy point is that \"military\" applications are much broader than just a few chips thrown onto a missile. Any modern military has a voracious appetite for computing power.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Oh well, it's not a good idea to look at \"the top 500 supercomputer list\", because China stopped participating in the ranking.\n\nhttps:\/\/thenewstack.io\/top500-chinas-supercomputing-silence-aggravates-tech-cold-war-with-u-s\/\n\nHowever,\n\nhttps:\/\/www.techradar.com\/pro\/the-most-powerful-machine-yet-assembled-on-earth-china-quietly-launched-record-breaking-supercomputer-and-someone-virtually-deconstructed-its-processor\n\nAs I said, there is no evidence chip ban has any effect on Chinese military.

And because semiconductor manufacturing requires scale in order to be effective, it's hard to believe that the Chinese are using home-grown chips on par with the western world's cutting edge, and easier to believe that they're bypassing the export controls by continuing to buy U.S.-designed processors.\n\nIf you're saying that the controls are being bypassed, that's a fair discussion to have, but that's a fundamentally different argument than the idea that a military can keep up with only access to mature\/legacy nodes.","role":"assistant"}]}

Unemployment is based on how many people are looking for work but can't find it.\n\nThe real reason the fed should consider lowering the rate though is real wage gains have slowed and inflation seems to be trending downward.

We're speaking in theoretical terms now, because I don't know how much wages have decreased in Argentina specifically.

The subsidies, according to the EU, create a \u201cthreat of economic harm\u201d to European car manufacturers.\n\nSounds like the easiest way to keep European car companies from having to compete with China or produce their own affordable EVs.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Same in the US.","role":"user"},{"content":"China is engaging in supply side economics. \u00a0The US leans more on the\u00a0demand side (subsidize the consumer with tax rebates).\n\nIf the US leaned into demand side to hard this forum would be drowned in wails of \u201cwe are subsidizing rich people and corporations, waaaaah!\u201d\n\nA nation state that isn\u2019t burdened with New Synthesis model demand side economics and practices both demand and supply has an unfair advantage?\n\nThat is one way to look at it. \u00a0Another take is the religious like zeal of holding on to purely demand based management of an economy like it\u2019s post depression\/WW2 is putting the US and EU at a disadvantage.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Another way to look at it, just to put it out there, is that China, the US, and the EU are all doing what makes sense for them, and there's no problem and nothing to worry about.\n\nI think people see \"tariff\" and immediately think \"bad, something must be wrong\" because oversimplified economics education taught them that knee-jerk reaction.\n\nBut you may have a situation where one country wants to heavily subsidize an industry to grow it rapidly, for perfectly legitimate and understandable reasons. China wants to do this with EVs, they have much stronger incentives to do so than America or Europe do. China has much worse congestion\/pollution and also their existing gas auto industry isn't that big\/important a part of their economy compared to the US and EU.\n\nWhereas in the US and EU the smog isn't a factor in the same way, and subsidizing EVs like this would cause tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in losses at automakers in the short term. You can still say it would be worth it, I even kind of agree, but the point is that there's reasons this kind of supply side subsidy is less politically possible in the US and EU.\n\nSo if a foreign country wants to subsidize and you don't want to take that route to match them, for whatever reasons, then tariffs are the best solution.\n\nSure it might be better for America and Europe if China just didn't subsidize in the first place and we didn't have to do tariffs, in that sense sure, tariffs are bad, if you want to look at it that way.\n\nBut who the hell are we to tell people in Beijing they have to keep driving gas cars and breathing suffocating smog every day just to make OUR economy slightly stronger?\n\nIt makes sense for China to subsidize their EV industry and it makes sense for the US and the EU to put up tariffs. Nobody has to think that this is a bad thing or must inevitably devolve into a trade war or whatever. It's a particular industry that they're subsidizing for particular reasons that make perfect sense, there is no problem.","role":"user"},{"content":"&gt;So if a foreign country wants to subsidize and you don't want to take that route to match them, for whatever reasons, then tariffs are the best solution.\n\nExcuse me, what!?\n\n\"Best\" for whom exactly?\n\nSuppose the case with no tariffs. The foreign country subsidizes cars, exports them here. Local people get the option to buy cheap vehicle. Not only cheap but subsidized -- essentially this is free money granted to them by generous foreign government. Local people now have spare money. Their standard of living gets a boost via a subsidy from the foreign government.\n\nNow your \"best\" solution. The local government gets tariff money, essentially raising taxes on population. Grabbing the subsidy for itself. Worse, it taxes the most affordable vehicles, so the tax burden disproportionally hits less affluent citizens. Even more worse, it disproportionally hits the environmentally-friendly product, artificially forcing people to choose polluting technology instead.\n\nAnother controversial point is, governments aren't super efficient at spending collected taxes wisely. It is possible for a government to distribute funds more efficiently than the market economy it governs. But in the concrete case of present-day EU, I've some doubts about it.","role":"assistant"}]}

In 2000, that figure was less than 400,000.\n\nThis doesn't support the headline, however. All it says is more people are collecting outside of the country. It doesn't say the reason they moved out of country. You can't say the reason more people collect outside the country is because \"the US is too expensive\" without proof of that.\n\nIs it true though? Probably, because there's tens of millions more people collecting Social Security in the year 2022 than there was in the year 2000. The absolute number probably went up, yes. Also, the percentage collecting outside the country did increase, but that doesn't necessarily mean the percentage went up because of the cost of living, there are other possible reasons. I'm guessing a lot more foreign born people are collecting Social Security now than they did in 2000. Maybe they want to go back to their original countries to retire?

One of the reasons housing costs have gone up is that people with ridiculously low pandemic era interest rates are not selling their homes because they don't want to lose their interest rates. This keeps the supply short which increases costs. Lowering the interest rates might actually cause more houses to go on the market which might mean a better situation for buyers. \n\nAlso unemployment went up despite jobs being added...because more people are looking for work, not because there are more unemployed people. Unemployment is based on how many people are looking for work but can't find it.\n\nThe real reason the fed should consider lowering the rate though is real wage gains have slowed and inflation seems to be trending downward. This implies that if rates were lowered it might boost the economy but not so much that inflation goes up again. There I essentially room for a rate cut that doesn't damage the economy.","role":"user"},{"content":"That probably won't help much.

If that really is the case, then the price signal there is clear and home builders should start to try to capitalize on that increased profit by building more homes\/rental units (which again in theory drives down aggregate costs for homes\/rental units because now you lots of private actors trying to capture market share through increased production. \n\nI say in theory because economic systems are complicated and it's very easy to have the demand and profit be evident through clear price signaling, but their ends up being other barriers that prevent people from acting on those incentives (we see this all the time in California, there is so much incentive for a home build out, but the costs to navigate state\/local regulations\/requirements becomes so complicated\/time consuming\/expensive that only a few developers can actually operate in the space, and even those developers aren't able to respond to the kinds of housing needed (IE low income housing) because there just isn't enough profit on the other side of that whole process to justify building them.)","role":"user"},{"content":"I appreciate your thoughtful reply. I had a thought, and I'm by no means an economist, but what would be the best way for international partners to alleviate the human suffering, in a strictly scientific sense? Pure cash aid, IMF loans, very generous foreign government investment, maybe something I'm not thinking of, or all of the above?","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Loans and development are tricky. \n\nIf were giving them for specific development of specific industries (IE increasing the supply of certain goods) then I think they can be valuable long term. \n\nInfrastructure too that provides and improves economic access can be good long term (and I mean in the industrial\/resources\/agriculture sense, so rail\/roads\/ports that are meant to improve better production and throughput of those things. There also is aid\/loans that provide the right economic environment for value added stuff. So for example you can't really have an IT sector until you have good telecommunication infrastructure and most countries that lack that are going to need to bring in international businesses and experts to help get it going). \n\nIt can also be extremely counterproductive. If you look at how international assistance to Africa over the last few decades in the form of loans and aid packages you can see how that manifests. \n\nWhen you provide governments with resources that they then use to service basic needs for the population, all you end up doing is undermining that countries population from developing local industries to serve those needs (IE if you give lots of food aid, you end up driving the local farmers out of business because they can't compete with free), which consequently means they end up not actually resolving the underlying conditions that made the loan\/aid necessary in the first place. In a way you end up doing economic damage in the long term (although there is an argument for some places like Sudan, where the aid provided is usually the only thing keeping mass starvation at bay). \n\nIMF loans are often seen as tools for western financial neo-imperialism and in a way, they are. But, they also put conditions on their loans for good reasons. Oftentimes the most dysfunctional countries that need aid\/loans are lacking good fundamental structures in the first place. So corruption is the norm, payouts to specific constituencies or supporters is the norm, the rule of law is lacking, and existing structures create real roadblocks to even getting the aid\/loan money to where it needs to be. In that context you can see loan conditions with policy adjustments attached to them as pretty reasonable given that the aid\/loans will be counterproductive without those structural changes happening (Imagine you accept food aid, lose a bunch of farming infrastructure an production, and then have to get even more the next time because now you need more, oh but hey you also have to still pay back that loan, it can create a death spiral in that economic sector). \n\nI think the human suffering question is one where the question of aid\/loans needs to be centered around helping people help themselves. With the exception being that sometimes if you want to stop something horrible happening you have to make concessions to a dysfunctional system when creating agreements.","role":"user"},{"content":"Lovely answer.

The stairs to my third-floor Brooklyn walk-up apartment would leave me dizzy and winded, my ears ringing, heart beating out of my chest. At 32, I\u2019d joined the 12 percent of Americans who report serious difficulty with stairs. On bad days, I became a prisoner in my own home.\n\n&gt;A few months later, visiting Bucharest, I rode the elevator in my mother\u2019s five-story building. A developer in a much poorer Eastern European country could afford to include an elevator, but the developer of my luxury five-story building in Brooklyn, built 25 years after the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, could not? I quit my job in real estate and started a nonprofit focused on building codes and construction policy.\n\n&gt;Through my research on elevators, I got a glimpse into why so little new housing is built in America and why what is built is often of such low quality and at high cost. The problem with elevators is a microcosm of the challenges of the broader construction industry \u2014 from labor to building codes to a sheer lack of political will. These challenges are at the root of a mounting housing crisis that has spread to nearly every part of the country and is damaging our economic productivity and our environment.\n\n&gt;\u2026Similar themes explain everything from our stalled high-speed rail development to why it\u2019s so hard to find someone to fix a toilet or shower.

Unemployment is based on how many people are looking for work but can't find it.\n\nThe real reason the fed should consider lowering the rate though is real wage gains have slowed and inflation seems to be trending downward.

Domestic companies rule the market for EVs, not Chinese. The govt is forcing Chinese brands to JV up with domestic companies, e.g. JSW and SAIC\/MG Motors.

India was the 5th largest producer of motor vehicles last year, at around 5.8 million vehicles. Korea (6th) at 4.2m, Japan (4th) at \\~9m. Since you have read the article, you will see that India produced more vehicles than were sold in the country - of course, countries like SK and Mexico and Japan export much more than consumed within. India just consumes most of what it makes. \n\nIndia had a trade surplus of $6 billion last year with regards to PVs.

India has a robust automotive supply chain of both domestic and international suppliers that supply to both domestic and international brands housed within its borders as well as outside.

India's biggest issue is that it has no problem creating competitive supply chains and products in capital intensive industries (automotive, vaccines and pharma, electronics, aerospace, etc) but is extremely incompetent at building them in labor-intensive industries like textiles, shoes, furniture, food processing and agriculture.

The stairs to my third-floor Brooklyn walk-up apartment would leave me dizzy and winded, my ears ringing, heart beating out of my chest. At 32, I\u2019d joined the 12 percent of Americans who report serious difficulty with stairs. On bad days, I became a prisoner in my own home.\n\n&gt;A few months later, visiting Bucharest, I rode the elevator in my mother\u2019s five-story building. A developer in a much poorer Eastern European country could afford to include an elevator, but the developer of my luxury five-story building in Brooklyn, built 25 years after the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, could not? I quit my job in real estate and started a nonprofit focused on building codes and construction policy.\n\n&gt;Through my research on elevators, I got a glimpse into why so little new housing is built in America and why what is built is often of such low quality and at high cost. The problem with elevators is a microcosm of the challenges of the broader construction industry \u2014 from labor to building codes to a sheer lack of political will. These challenges are at the root of a mounting housing crisis that has spread to nearly every part of the country and is damaging our economic productivity and our environment.\n\n&gt;\u2026Similar themes explain everything from our stalled high-speed rail development to why it\u2019s so hard to find someone to fix a toilet or shower.

Once this delicate fabric of society is unwoven the damage cannot be undone. All these leftists on this sub are just completely ignoring that Europe and Canada are tanking right now, and a big reason is unchecked migration. \n\nThe solution is immigration reform and drastically reducing the intake of migrants.
