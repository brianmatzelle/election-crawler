{"messages":[{"content":"I want to be very clear that I am sympathetic to Hasan's position of attempting to use a conversation with Asmongold as a way to reach his audience and potentially de-program some of them. Unfortunately, I do not think it worked, and instead it allowed Asmon to evade and water down his message while maintaining his core position. He got to dress up his position in slightly better words, but it remained largely the same.\n\nTo remind people, Asmongold stated that **Palestinians and Arabs have an inferior culture that is evil and immoral.** He doubled down on this the entire stream, and refused to budge even an inch on it. Whenever Hasan would press him, or make analogies to the US, Asmon would simply state that he thought \"Parts of US culture is bad too.\" as an out, but he would never make the same sweeping generalizations about US culture, yet felt completely comfortable to do so about Arabs &amp; Muslims.\n\nIt was disgusting to listen to. I do not think he is arguing in good faith -- Asmongold has the means, time, and money to research and develop an in-depth opinion on the middle-east. He doesn't. He instead plays to his right-wing audience while back-pedaling whenever it goes too far to maintain his centrist image. \n\nArab culture is not evil or immoral. Arab people are kind, community driven people who care about honesty and integrity for the most part. Most Arabs are fine with live and let live, and if asked, would not want the death of LGBTQ+ people. Arab culture is my culture, and is filled with songs and poetry and food and scientific development. Arabs under an Islamic caliphate invented things like Algebra, developed chemistry, and invented a wide range of things we still use today like Kerosene, Hard soaps, wind powered structures of various sorts, sugar mills and more. There is literally a massive wikipedia page dedicated to the developments in science under the Golden Age of Islam. This was at a time when western europeans were dying of common diseases because hand washing was not a thing.\n\nDuring the middle ages, where Europe was burning witches at the stake and gay people were tortured for sport, the Islamic world had openly gay philosophers. In the tradition of Sufi Islam, poets like Rumi **wrote about the great joys of homosexual love.** The laws against homosexuality on the books were rarely invoked. We know this because Arabs kept extensive court records and we can physically see with our own eyes how rare this was.\n\nThis does not mean there weren't problems or reactionaries, or periods of regression, but this is a beautiful vibrant culture with a long history of progressive development that Asmongold completely dismissed.\n\nAsmongold, from his air-conditioned comfortable home sitting in an imperialist country that routinely destroys other peoples homes, hand-waved thousands of years of human development as if it was nothing, and then used some regressive modern regimes (created directly and indirectly by his own government) to play defense for Israel's genocide. \n\nThe conversation with him was extremely painful and sad, and as my friends and family in Lebanon feels the weight of American bombs, I find it all so abhorrent and unfair.

{"messages":[{"content":"A wonderful community member has compiled a bunch of evidence disproving the claim that the Yemeni guy Hasan had on the broadcast is a Houthi rebel. I\u2019m reposting their evidence here in hopes lurkers from the H3 community will let Ethan know he got duped by dummies like Destiny. The timeline of events is below. I will link the tweet (which contains sources and way more info) in the comments.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Timeline \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nNovember 19th, 2023\n\nThe Houthi rebels hijack the Galaxy Leader and take its crew hostage. Their stated reason is to disrupt commercial shipping in order to pressure western powers to stop the genocide in Gaza.\n\nDecember 6th, 2023\n\nAl Arabiya English reports that the Houthis have turned the Galaxy Leader into a tourist attraction for the Yemeni public. By December 19th, 2023, thousands of Yemenis had visited the ship, according to The New Arab.\n\nJanuary 13th, 2024\n\n19 year old Rashid Al-Haddad goes viral for a TikTok he filmed while onboard the Galaxy, now a tourist attraction. TikTok users who were unaware the Galaxy had been opened to the public thought Rashid was a Houthi hijacker. The internet dubs him \u201cthe Hot Houthi\u201d and \u201cTimhouthi Chalomet\u201d.\n\nJanuary 16th, 2024\n\nDuring Hasan\u2019s daily stream, a chatter asks if he would be interested in talking to the viral \u201cHot Houthi\u201d of TikTok. Hasan thinks he is a Houthi rebel and wants to ask him about the hijacking. He asks the chatter to set up a call. Another chatter asks Hasan if he is really going to have a Houthi rebel on stream and Hasan says yes. The interview begins, and Hasan immediately asks Rashid if he is a member of Ansarallah. Rashid clarifies that he is just a civilian, and that the ship is open to the public for tourism. Realizing he can\u2019t ask Rashid about the hijacking, Hasan instead asks him about growing up in Yemen, the wars, Palestine, anime, junk food, etc.\n\nJanuary 17th, 2024\n\nThe US State Department releases a statement announcing the decision to designate Ansarallah a terror group, effective 30 days from the statement date.\n\nRegarding the hostages:\n\nRashid has never met the hostages, nor did he claim to have met them.\n\nDuring the interview, Rashid tells Hasan that the captain of the Galaxy is Chinese, and that he (the captain) was hanging out with the Houthis rebels, chewing khat and dancing to music. Note: Rashid did not say that **he** had hung out with the captain, but that the Houthis had. \n\nThe captain of the Galaxy Leader is, in fact, a white Bulgarian man named Lubomir Chanev. The reason Rashid thought the captain was Chinese is because he saw a viral video that falsely claimed to show the Galaxy captain partying with the Houthis. The video shows an Asian man chewing khat at some kind of party.\n\nThe video does not actually show the Galaxy crew or the Houthis. It was a random video of a reception that had been posted on YouTube two years earlier, on March 27, 2022. Remember, the Galaxy was hijacked on November 19th, 2023.\n\nIf Rashid had actually met the ship\u2019s captain, he would have known he isn\u2019t Chinese. Rashid\u2019s words were misinterpreted as saying he personally vibed with the captain. What he actually said was that the Houthis were vibing with the captain.\n\n(Source tweet in comments)","role":"user"},{"content":"This is all very well, but the purpose of the claims is to attack their enemy.

This premise they are arguing from is essentially that Palestine has inferior culture but Hasan is imploring asmon as to *why* that is. Asmon will say he thinks their culture is inferior, Hasan asks if asmon thinks this is justification for genocide, asmon says no. \n\nHasan shouldn\u2019t be accepting the \u2018lesser culture\u2019 framing at all imo, there should be wayy more pushback on that intial frame. We moved away from the term \u2018third world\u2019 because even *that* term was too negatively moralising. Then it moved between underdeveloped and global south. Imo if Asmon wanted to say that Palestinians have *some* aspects of their culture that are underdeveloped, that would be okay. Hasan could then come in and explain how Western colonial oppression of Middle Eastern material conditions has impeded their development. \n\nThen the argument\/solution becomes easy, give them better *support* toward improving material conditions so that these aspects of their culture which are actively impeded have the room to develop. This also gets away from the better\/worse framing. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re better than your poor friend (hopefully) because they aren\u2019t as economically developed.

It rallies the Liberals to him.\n\nThe Democratic party is a liberal party. She's probably close to a socdem.\n\nIt's far more relevant that Pelosi and Schumer and Jeffries are calling for Biden to drop out. \n\nThey've pretty much done so openly now. \n\nAdam Schiff is super close to Democratic leadership. he's been on the record calling for Biden to drop out.\n\nThere are reports that Obama has asked him to drop out\n\nThe liberal leadership of the democratic party is against Joe Biden now. If you're somebody like AOC there's nothing you can bring to this fight at this point.\n\nIf bidens selfish and refuses to work with Democratic leadership he wasn't going to cave just because AOC called him out. None of AOC'S voter base was going to vote for biden anyways because of his support of genocide\n\nBiden was a United States senator for longer than AOC has been alive. She does not have clout with him. If Biden's willing to burn his relationships with people like Pelosi and Schumer who he's known for decades and possibly even his relationship with Obama who offered to pay for his son's cancer treatments, then there is no way he caves because AOC asks him to resign.\n\nAOC attacking Biden literally does nothing.

Biden was a United States senator for longer than aoc's been alive. There's zero chance he respects her to a high degree. \n\nSo on the one hand attacking Biden for AOC does literally nothing.\n\nNow let's look at the scenario where Biden is extremely selfish and refuses to drop out. He becomes the nominee and he is the lesser evil compared to Trump in every single way.\n\nI get down voted for saying this but Biden is the best US president of my lifetime. Yes he's been a better president than Obama.\n\nI genuinely don't see the DNC nominating a candidate as pro labor as Joe Biden has been for a long time.\n\nTo be clear in a perfect world Joe Biden would be in jail at The Hague for being genocide Joe. \n\nIt's just all American presidents are horrendous war criminals. \n\nTrump has called Joe Biden a Palestinian because he thinks Biden is not helping Israel enough. Specifically he called Biden a week Palestinian. \n\nIf it comes down to Trump versus Biden AOC would want Biden to win.\n\nIf people like Adam Schiff, Jim Clyburn, Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama, etc cannot convince Joe Biden to drop out then AOC correctly deduces that she would not be able to do so either.\n\nSo once you're at the point where it's Trump versus Biden you're going to eventually pretend Biden is a great candidate no matter how flawed he is. \n\nAOC is just getting ahead of the curve.\n\nAnd on the 30% chance that the anti-trump vote is strong enough that Joe Biden wins off of Just the anti-trump vote then you have the situation where stubborn vengeful Joe Biden remembers that the one group of Democrats that didn't call on him to drop out was the progressives.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Some have reported that Bernie and the squad negotiated the small promises like the rent cap and Supreme Court reform (but not expansion of the court, which is the only solution) in return for the endorsement.

However, you left out what\u2019s looking like a very likely outcome: Biden is forced to step down, and progressives spent their political capital backing a loser and genocide supporter, didn\u2019t get anything in return, basically cementing their irrelevance on top of losing credibility among their pro-Palestine base.

Americans just are horribly indoctrinated and America is a fundamentally evil Nation.\n\n\nEdit: two additional points. \n\n1. Supreme Court expansion would be opposed by a lot of Democrats in purple States. We've been at 9 supreme Court justices since the 1860s. We are always going to be at 9 going forward\n\nI don't think even if somebody like Bernie Sanders were elected president he could actually successfully get the Senate to approve supreme Court expansion. There were decades where the Liberals had the majority on the supreme Court and presidencies like George w bush where they could not appoint people they wanted to the supreme Court. Even a party as strong as the Republicans didn't pursue supreme Court expansion. This is kind of an unrealistic dream of leftists and liberals. Eg. You would never be able to convince purple State Democrats to join in and support ratifying supreme Court nominees to expand the court.\n\n\n2. If we had a president like Bernie Sanders that actually tried to stop providing funds for Israel you would see bipartisan funding bills passed through Congress with veto proof majorities.

They are weird as hell but I'm not entirely sure it's worth imprisoning.\n\nWithin one year we consider that 17-year-old an adult.\n\nZoomers strongly disagree with me. They consider it clearly rape. \n\nThey expected somebody like Hasan to react to it about the same as discovering Cody Ko put roofies in Tana's drink or something. \n\nAnd by that standard Hasan did under react\n\nEdit: if I wasn't clear meant to give credit to young people for caring more about problemic age gaps.\n\nI am trying to say I think zoomers are correct to be hypersensitive about problemic age gaps\n\nIt just wasn't like this when I was 17. 16-17 year old girls used to date college guys. \n\nI think it's progress that they don't.\n\nI think we used to let kids be adult too soon as a society.\n\nI just know too many couples that started in an age gap that would not be ok today\n\n\nEg. Nick and Malena started their relationship when he was 22 and she was 17.","role":"user"},{"content":"I don't think zoomers are overreacting at all.. just because people you knew, under the designations of the law, committed statutory rape and you personally found it to be personally acceptable, doesn't change the reality of what it was.
