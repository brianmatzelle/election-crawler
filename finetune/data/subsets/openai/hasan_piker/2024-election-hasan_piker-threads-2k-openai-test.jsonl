Try to appeal to Republicans who think Trump does not have enough decorum. Eg. Liz Cheney actually used to talk about post birth abortions, and has said some horrible things in regards to immigration, but she has more decorum than Trump and Kamala Harris literally held a campaign event to highlight that she now endorses her. \n\n2. Making a huge part of her economic policy being pro small business owner. economics is somewhat of a zero sum game. if you constantly talk about how much you want to help small scale capital owners, you\u2019re kind of signalling that you care less about labour.\n\n3. She\u2019s running as a Warhawk. Multiple times, she has talked about wanting the US military to be the most lethal fighting force in the world and threatened to destroy Iran if they touch Israel. (Emma argues she doesn\u2019t actually believe this and is not an ideological Zionist but needs to compensate for being a black woman)\n\n4. She has completely abandoned Arab and Muslim Americans, and signalled to them that she doesn\u2019t care about them at all. Among Her surrogates she has chosen to include people like Richie Torres and Bill Clinton. Her campaign refused to give 5 mins to a Palestinian voice at her convention. She spreads the belief that this conflict started on October 7 and the unproven accusation that hamas went into Israel to rape Israeli women. Despite Israel committing genocide, she has promised on multiple occasions to never stop giving them weapons and describes what Israel is doing as self defence. \n\nAlso according to international law an occupier does not have the right to defend themselves against military effort of the people they are occupying to end that occupation. Eg. The Russian federation does not have the right to defend their forces from Ukrainian attacks on internationally recognized Ukrainian soil. Very similarly the IDF does not have the right to defend its soldiers in Gaza and Lebanon (Somehow Emma vigeland still argues that she isn\u2019t a Zionist.)\n\n5. She has almost completely abandoned the left. She never mentions wanting universal healthcare. She never mentions wanting to limit carbon emissions and get rid of stuff like fracking. In fact, she talks about how much she supports fracking and how she\u2019s the type of person that is always strapped and loves guns and will shoot you with her Glock to protect her home and property. (Emma argues that this is overcompensating for being a black woman.)\n\n6. She Has run her campaign as being anti-immigration. She literally accuses Trump of not actually caring about the border. Basically she highlights that Jim Lankford wrote an extremely right wing order bill that Biden tried to pass in Congress, but Trump called the Republicans and told them not to support it so that immigration would still be an issue during the election. She has openly stated that she would have passed that bill and she would have built the wall. Her Basic argument has become that she actually cares about stopping immigration and that Trump is only using it for politics.\n\n7. When asked about what\u2019s the biggest difference between her and Joe Biden and what she would do different from genocide Joe Biden she has openly stated that she intends to appoint a republican to her cabinet in an important position. She has literally signaled that the one thing she disagrees with Joe Biden on is that he hasn't appointed a republican to his cabinet.\n\n\nI will Admit that a part of me is wish casting that this is a bad strategy.\n\nDo you guys agree with Emma that this is actually a smart strategy? The basic premise being that America is not as progressive as leftists like to believe and leftists need to lie to some extent to get into office.","role":"user"},{"content":"If Kamala does win on the back of this strategy I think it\u2019s fair to say that\u2019s more an inditement of Trump than it is a vindication of Harris.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"I\u2019d agree with this.

You'll just get people derailing if you tell them he's a Socialist. They'll immediately force you to pivot to Venezuela and talk about how the Soviet Union killed millions blah blah blah. You'll be stuck in that trap. \n\nIf you want to explain his world view to them it's pretty easy. He uses a materialist analysis as a lens to view political issues through the world: i.e. who has power, who controls the resources, who controls the means of production.  Gaza for example, his viewpoint would be that the IDF and Israeli government control the resources and territory, have military superiority and wield it to control the lives of those with less access to those resources and power. They have less rights than Jewish Israelis under the state's control and have their homes destroyed\/taken away regularly in an oppressive fashion. Using that analysis, you don't need to consider religion or historical context, you can see who's oppressed and who's not simply from the division of resources and power. This can be applied to any conflict, any subgroup, any issue as long as you apply materialist analysis to find a moral stance that corrects for inequality. Every single policy take he has can be viewed through that lens and predicted.\n\n  \nOther than that, he's a self-admitted hedonist, which just means he enjoys pleasurable things. A nice meal, a cool car, a house that his family can live in, friendships, video games. \n\n  \nIt's important not to fall into the pitfall of having to explain socialism though, because you'll just get frustrated. Americans in particular don't know what it is, and assume it means everyone's poor except one rich guy (except they're describing authoritarian capitalist regimes with that).

{"messages":[{"content":"The gender gap between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris voters in the 2024 presidential race is the largest in U.S. history, new poll finds; Andy Beshear faces scrutiny on abortion as possible VP pick","role":"user"},{"content":"**Article transcript:**\n\n&gt;A slew of national and battleground state polls since President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race find a much closer contest than we saw after his dismal debate performance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But these polls reveal another important dynamic: an enormous gender gap between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 in some cases bigger than the one in 2016 and 2020.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Take the recent New York Times\/Siena College poll. Harris holds a 14-point lead over Trump among likely female voters (55% to 41%), while Trump holds a 17-point lead among men (56% to 39%). That\u2019s a net 31-point gender gap.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's even bigger in the latest Quinnipiac University poll, where women are breaking for Harris by 16 points (56% to 40%) and men are siding with Trump by 23 points (60% to 37%). *(Note: The Quinnipiac poll was conducted before and after Biden exited the 2024 race.)* That\u2019s a whopping 39-point gender gap.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Compare that to the race between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016, when the NBC News exit poll found the net gender gap at 24 points. In the exit poll after the 2020 Biden-Trump contest, that figure stood at 23 points.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now, other recent surveys show a smaller gender gap. CNN's national poll had it at 16 points between Harris and Trump, and one from NPR\/PBS\/Marist was a mere 4 points.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And remember, these kinds of demographic deep dives have larger margins of error \u2014 so numbers are bound to fluctuate from poll to poll.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But in general, these new polls underscore how a widening gender gap could be a significant factor in the new Harris-Trump race \u2014 as well as how Trump's advantage among men seems larger than Harris' edge among women.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Veepstakes: Beshear's abortion record gets fresh scrutiny**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's strengths in the race to become Harris' running mate is that he could appeal to centrist voters as a Democrat who won re-election in a state that Donald Trump carried by more than 20 percentage points.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Beshear won his 2023 campaign, in part, by leaning into his support for abortion rights in a state where the procedure is almost entirely banned. Yet for some reproductive rights advocates in Kentucky, Beshear has not done enough on an issue that is critical for the party nationally \u2014 which could factor into his chances of joining the presidential ticket.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The low bar here doesn't help him,\" said Savannah Trebuna, the abortion fund director at Kentucky Health Justice Network, a Louisville-based reproductive rights organization, referring to the expectations for a Democratic governor in a red state.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Yes, he's doing better than a conservative would, and I'm thankful for that,\" she continued. \"But I worry about how that record will look on a national stage.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Critics point to Beshear's choice of a self-described \"personally pro-life\" Democrat, Jacqueline Coleman, to be his lieutenant governor; his focus on rare exceptions when talking about abortion; and that his administration has avoided working closely with reproductive rights groups in the state.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During his first gubernatorial campaign in 2019, Beshear's allies clashed behind the scenes with reproductive rights groups over what message to run in ads, with Beshear's team wanting to focus less on abortion and more on the unpopular Republican incumbent, according to a source involved in the effort.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The question is whether Beshear's approach would serve as a liability by muddling Democrats' message, or as a benefit by having a governor who has won on the issue in a red state.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"I think everybody's looking for the perfect candidate. There is no such thing,\" said former Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky. \"Voters who are persuadable at this point are not issue voters. If you're an issue voter, you've already made up your mind.

The entire reason they didn't hold a primary this year and propped Joe up until it was over is because it was a virtually guarantee any leftist would destroy any genocidal wall street puppet, the dems have spent billions to keep the left suppressed and marginalized within the party, if they took their boot off of our necks for one full election cycle there would be like 3 centrists and the rest of the DNC would be leftist. \n\nI'm literally in awe of opinions like this given that there's virtually no polling that's ever been done on anything that would suggest leftists are a tiny portion of America. We literally use phrases like \"pie on the sky\" daily that come directly out of socialist labor organizing songs like Preacher and the Slave. \n\nWe absolutely should be voting, not for wall street, but for high quality candidates with a beautiful platform that matches the interests and goals and claimed positions of most Americans, such as Claudia de la Cruz and Karina Garcia ticket from the Party for Socialism and Liberation. \n\nAnd I mean that's not even getting into the fact that you're eager to vote for a genocidal dirty prosecutor who kept innocent men in prison to get free labor out of them, that her career represents a level of right wing extremist depravity that's unacceptable in any situation, but especially as president where she will be able to direct the CIA to expand dramatically it's torture programs and direct the feds to be wildly more abusive to leftists of all kinds. \n\nThe fact that one of them is going to win in November is of no consequence, that was always the case and both of them are such extreme, radically sadistic evil for wall street and against working people that I think it's comical to act like the marginal difference of Kamala pretending she doesn't want to exterminate leftists until the campaigns over and she can go back to being hatefully sadistic towards us like so far  across her entire career. The situations dire and your vote can contribute to the new consensus, can help show mass, widespread dissatisfaction with the DNC behavior, can show they can't jut force a wall street candidate on us over and over and over and over again and keep getting our votes, especially in swing states where it creates the deepest pressure on the parties to look inward and reform to capture those critical votes, lest they completely lose power. \n\nAlso remember how under Trump democrats acted like they were leftists, only to turn around and stab us in the back literally January 22nd, 2021 once a democrat was president again?

To some extent, I think that's to be expected, as we all knew Biden isn't really capable of being the president of a country right now*. However, this isn't in line with what the people in this subreddit actually say.\n\nWhenever there is the discussion as to whether voting for democrats or for an anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist or working class candidate, there used to be people advocating for voting democrat in the subreddit, but not nearly as much as now. And here's what's most curious: these people never actually say anything regarding Kamala, they just say things regarding trump and the republicans and project 2025. So that got me thinking, if these are the main points here, and if that hasn't changed at all since Biden dropped out, what is the actual cause of the change in this subreddit's posture regarding the elections and the democrats? Why has the change in candidate, from reelection of the current president to the election of the current vice president made people go from \"maybe we should try to change things for the better for once\" to \"Vote democrat or else you'll be a literal chattel slave!!!\"\n\n\n\n *Although Biden clearly doesn't have the mental capacity to be a country's president, that hasn't really affected the way the country is run. That's because in the USA, politics aren't made by just one personality in government doing things he thinks are right. They are made by a party and by the party's donors. For example, Biden doesn't understand the geopolitical rivalry between the USA and China, yet still announced a 100% tax on EVs cause it would be beneficial to USA billionaires (main donors) such as Elon musk, whose company Tesla can't compete with Chinese EVs.","role":"user"},{"content":"Some of it is astroturfing.

They can't push her with policy, so they're coming in here with large numbers to do a vibes-based popularity campaign.\n\n\n\nIt'll probably fade out after a bit.

I think she'll hold onto her Cease Fire stance (which is the bare minimum for us), because if she doesn't she probably loses Michigan and possibly the whole election. It's smart to oppose Netanyahu, who will likely openly endorse Trump either at the speech or in the coming weeks. He'll force an opposition position to the democrats, which benefits us.\n\nYou're spot on with corporate friendly capitalist and cop bit though. \n\n  \nShe sucks, but she's better than Biden and better than Trump, and we're not going to be given anyone else better right now.","role":"user"},{"content":"Hard pass.

I don't think it's unreasonable to say \"okay I'll cede the point of foreign policy issues.

{"messages":[{"content":"My take as a Jewish H3 fan\n\nHey folks, \n\n  \nI just got around to finishing the \"Addressing Hasan\" segment and thought I'd come on here and share a few of my thoughts. I have been a massive fan of the H3 pod for many years. I watch every show and have been a member for about two years. I will continue to support the show and watch every episode.   \n  \nWith that said, I disagree with Ethan on several key points he made on the Wednesday show. I am going to try not to assume anything and will only base my criticism on the words spoken by Ethan on the Wednesday show and his Instagram stories before and after the show. \n\n  \n**1. Defining a Zionist.** I agree with Ethan that there are many varying definitions of a Zionist. There are people who want to expand settlements and expand the size of Israel. There are also people who support the actions of the IDF entirely,  including killing as many Palestinians and Lebanese as they want, but these people may not want to actually expand the reach of Israel, nor do they care about settlements. Then, there is a third group of people who do not want Israel to be wiped out completely and are realistic about the reality, as Ethan said, 80% of Israelis were born in the country, and many of those people may have nowhere else to go. If this third group of people are Zionists, then I am also a Zionist. \n\nIn my opinion, I do not think the 90% of people who are anti-Zionist believe that Israel should not exist. In other words, I believe the vast majority of anti-zionist people are against the IDF committing genocide in Palestine and Lebanon and are against Israeli settlements. This creates an issue for Ethan when he refers to himself as a Zionist, or at least seems to state that he agrees with some definitions of a Zionist. In reality, Ethan is in agreement with the majority of people on this issue, as he shared in his Instagram story detailing his views on the IDFs response to Hamas in 2021. This ties nicely into my next criticism.\n\n  \n**2. Emphasizing That He is Against Israel Committing Genocide.** As stated in the previous paragraph, I do know that Ethan is against the genocide being committed by Israel. He recently shared an Instagram story that showed his opinions on the matter, even in 2021. Fast forward to the Wednesday episode and there was little to no mention of the atrocities being committed by Israel each day. Instead, he focused on the mistreatment of Jewish people. This does not look good and is not the best way to approach this argument. I understand that Ethan wants people to remember that he is against the Israeli army's actions and truly believes that what is happening is genocide, but he needs to emphasize that for the people in the back who may not watch every episode of his show. The way he explained himself on Wednesday made it sound like he cares way more about Antisemitism than he does about the genocide being committed by Israelis. This ties into my next criticism.\n\n  \n**3. Acknowledging the Severity of Mistreatment.** As a Jew, I know that antisemitism is real. I have experienced it, and I have experienced it more in the past year. I am sure Ethan experiences it way more than me, as he is a public figure and is barraged with comments every day that are antisemitic. This is not acceptable. It's important to acknowledge that. With that said, Ethan and the rest of the Jewish population, including in Israel, is by and large much safer than any person living in Palestine or Lebanon, or many of the other countries in the Middle East. Sure, there were about 1000 Jewish people killed in Israel on Oct 7; there have been maybe a few hundred more killed since then. There have been tens of thousands of innocent people murdered in Palestine and Lebanon in the past year with no sign of stopping. As a Jewish person, it honestly makes me cringe to hear Ethan saying that he and Hila are being mistreated. Yes, you are being mistreated, but let's be real. You are safe. You will not be murdered by a rocket falling from the sky. I know that words hurt, and they are a form of hate speech, but ultimately, you are safe. The idea that Jews are inherently unsafe because they were genocided during WWII is simply an outdated idea. Jewish people are a very powerful race in the modern day, especially in comparison to most of the other people living in the Middle East. They have billions of dollars of weaponry ready to defend them. Once again, I say this as a Jewish person living in the United States. \n\n  \n**4. Referring to People as \"Terrorists\"** This is a loaded term, and Ethan knows this. I realize that the One Piece guy from Yemen is most likely a member of the Houthi and is committing crimes, holding hostages, and all that. I am not going to argue he is doing good things. In my opinion, it is improper to refer to people in the Middle East committing crimes as terrorists unless you also refer to the IDF as terrorists and the United States Army as proxy terrorists. The IDF is causing terror and breaking international law by committing genocide. Not knowing if your home will be bombed at any moment is an act that could only be defined as terrorism. The United States supplies weaponry and assists in these atrocities. War is ugly, but killing innocent people without any notice is terrorism. \n\n  \n**5. Seeing No Problem with Kamala's Speech** There are issues with Kamala's speech saying that Israel has a right to defend itself. It may be technically correct, but it is, once again, not acknowledging that Israel is no longer defending itself and instead committing genocide. I will not harp on this anymore; I just wanted to share it as well. \n\n  \nAnyway, love the show, I really think Ethan is a great guy in his heart. I'm sure it is very hard to be constantly misunderstood, but it's important to be accurate and thoughtful when dealing with these things so that you end up on the right side of history.","role":"user"},{"content":"&gt;Then, there is a third group of people who do not want Israel to be wiped out completely and are realistic about the reality, as Ethan said, 80% of Israelis were born in the country, and many of those people may have nowhere else to go. If this third group of people are Zionists, then I am also a Zionist. \n\nIsrael cannot exist in its current format as a Jewish Supremacist state (as written into the Israeli Constitution). That being said, Hasan and most of his community acknowledge that it would be another atrocity to displace Israelis already living in the region. What Hasan advocates for when he mentions \"From the River to the Sea\" is that Israelis and Palestinians of all faith and denomination are afforded the same freedoms and protections under a single democratic state.\n\n&gt;I realize that the One Piece guy from Yemen is most likely a member of the Houthi and is committing crimes, holding hostages, and all that. I am not going to argue he is doing good things.\n\nThere is zero evidentiary basis for this. The notion that Rashad Al-Haddad is a member of Houthi is Western Chauvinist fabrication. He has said directly that he is not a member of the Houthi organization, it's just so typical of ignorant westerners to think all Yemenis are Houthis or all Palestinians are Hamas.

It's like now that I am, it's like I'm seeing things from a whole new perspective, and I feel like all of the arguments people here make for humans, can be applied to animals, and it just feels like a whole lot of people are preaching about how we should be better, while being complicit in one of the biggest horrors that exists.\n\nI feel like.. Like you know how we call what's going on in Gaza a genocide? Because.. well because it is a genocide.

We moved away from the term \u2018third world\u2019 because even *that* term was too negatively moralising. Then it moved between underdeveloped and global south. Imo if Asmon wanted to say that Palestinians have *some* aspects of their culture that are underdeveloped, that would be okay. Hasan could then come in and explain how Western colonial oppression of Middle Eastern material conditions has impeded their development. \n\nThen the argument\/solution becomes easy, give them better *support* toward improving material conditions so that these aspects of their culture which are actively impeded have the room to develop. This also gets away from the better\/worse framing. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re better than your poor friend (hopefully) because they aren\u2019t as economically developed. Hasan touched on some of this, but he could have done more to shut down the better\/worse framing imo.","role":"user"},{"content":"You're right and I am finding this whole conversation frustrating.

Anti-electoralism will enable fascism. We have no choice but to unite. Acknowledging it but not doing the singular thing that will give us the best chance we have at least to prevent the spread of authoritarianism is the epitome of a lack of critical thinking skills. The cost for downplaying the severity of the choices for us could very well undo your rights not just to vote but to passively dissent and to breathe air.  I see the depravity of Israel and their exterminationist genocidal rhetoric, neither candidate is notably different so I tend to default to america bad when judging the most important issue globally right now. Not that we give up on them we need to be louder than ever and keep being outspoken about the barbarism we are seeing on a daily basis because we know no one will. That really is fucked but it's how it is. I see how incompetent Joe Biden is, the only feasible alternative to him is Donald Trump.  Who is similarly incompetent but has a narcissistic vendetta complex who requires the approval of everyone around him and is known to have collaborated with putin who is with his oligarchy and expansionist policies is one of the larger enemies of communism and progressivism globally.  If neither candidate cares about what happens to Palestinians we have to look at what else they do. It feels ick but this is utilitarianism, we have to do what we can do to push the world left no matter what.  Even a marginal victory is indeed a victory. We can work with and convince Dems of our ideology because they cherry pick from American exceptionalism at the same time draw inspiration from our leaders and harken back to our arguments when confronted with the reality of the whole scope of the situation globally. There is no reasoning with the right when they seize power, if they win we die. If you want to you're free to but I'm gonna keep fighting for the left. Thanks for reading this, I hope you have a great day comrades stay strong be safe.","role":"assistant"}]}
