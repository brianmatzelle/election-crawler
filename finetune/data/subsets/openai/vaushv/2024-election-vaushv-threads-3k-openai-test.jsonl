But if you withold your vote or vote 3rd party  itmeans that you lose your leverage on Harris, because to Harris you're not a gettable vote so she won't try to appeal for your vote.

And while AOC's livestream was messy and rambly (I believe Beau of the Fifth Column's video about the difficulties of the logistics of replacing Biden is shorter and more concise), Vaush \"I Know More Than A Sitting Congressperson Because I Read Headline Out Loud For A Living And Barely Ever Go Outside\" Kochinski's response to the livestream was incoherent dogshit. Let's not kid ourselves with Vaush's bad arguments in regards to that video, which were on par with his bad media takes or his atrocious zero IQ  take on motorbikes and Vespas. \n\n.\n\n\nAnyways, I think the main reason why Bernie and AOC were so dogged in defending Biden till the end was because they were hyper aware of the optics of what it would look like and who would get blamed HARD if it was the Progressives who were leading the charge in calling for Biden to drop out. They would get done dirty by the centrist corporate Dems in case Biden or Harris lost the election in the scenario where the Progressives were one of the ones calling for Biden to drop out. Progressives had influence and rapport with Biden, something they wouldn't have with some centrist Dem replacement and they wanted to protect that rapport and goodwill. So by instead defending Biden from the calls to drop out from the centrist Dems, they at least protect the bridge of goodwill and reciprocity they have with Biden which will hopefully transfer to Harris and it helps the Progressives optically and politically at that (as I'm sure Bernie and AOC got some concessions out of Biden for their support). Sure, they got some egg in the face for defending Biden from dropping out till the end but it is NOT *nearly* as bad as it would be if it was portrayed optically for the Progressives if they were portrayed as the ones leading the charge in calling for Biden to drop out. Endorsing Kamala Harris will be no skin off the nose for Progressives. \n\n.\n\nBecause Bernie, AOC, and co. held the line for Biden  to the end, they not only saved Progressives optically in the long run but they also kept the bridge with Biden open and strong which is very important for one VERY big reason. Wile Kamala is the one running for election, Biden is still the POTUS until January 2025. Without the stress of re-election burdening him, Biden is more free and open to act in ways that he normally wouldn't be able to  willing to do with the thought of reelection. While this won't mean he'll go Ultra Dark Brandon and order any assassinations, it does open up an avenue for Biden to actually improve his handling of Gaza and to actually be harder on Netanyahu and Israel, among other things both domestically and abroad. Let's honestly ask ourselves, do you think Biden would be open and receptive to Progressives in the scenario where they were one of the ones who were calling for him to drop out? Or would Biden be MUCH more open and receptive to Progressives in the present scenario where Progressives held the line till the end of defending Biden from the calls for him to drop out by the centrist Dems who Biden was more ideologically aligned with, and thus protecting the bridge of goodwill, rapport, and influence that they have with Biden? The answer is obviously the latter. \n\n.\n\nBernie, AOC, and co.  defending Biden from the calls to drop out till the end was not a strategic blunder but strategic survival for Progressives and the Left. In dropping out of re-election, Joe Biden is now unburdened by what has been. And with the Progressives protecting the bridge they have with him till the end, Biden is unburdened enough and receptive to be influenced to more progressive policy ends and executive actions. The chances are much higher now compared to the alternative scenario. \n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"The simplest explanation makes the most sense. He was forced out.

The median low-info voter thinks all politicians are corrupt scumbags at the level of Trump, when in reality, this isn't true (our actual problem is true believers - if right-wingers could be bought off, it'd be a lot easier), but saying a politician was friends with a rich scumbag is just assumed by people. \n\n3.) It's not civility politics, it's issue politics - Democrat's, including elected officials, campaigners, and voters actually care about stuff like Medicare, abortion, Palestine, or whatever and would rather talk about that than Jeffery Epstein. Not our of civility, but because it's seen as silly, and that's whether you're a moderate or progressive. \n\nAn advantage the GOP has is they have a giant network of propagandists who don't care and a base who doesn't care about policy really, beyond being mean to immigrants. \n\nI'll put it this way - neither Neither AOC nor Abigail Spanberger wants to talk about Jeffery Epstein, while both Susan Collins and Matt Gaetz don't mind talking about Hunter Biden. \n\nAgain, prominent Democratic pollsters have likely run polling on Epstein and saw it probably doesn't effect Trump all that much.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"That's kind of what I figured, Vaush talking about this really reminded me of the first and only Jimmy Dore video I ever watched.

I\u2019m voting Biden still, but I ain\u2019t gonna cope my heart out that what\u2019s almost certain gonna happen isn\u2019t what almost certain gonna happen. \n\nBut I\u2019m not dooming in the sense that, as bad as I think Trump is, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the \u201cend to Democracy\u201d, he\u2019s not the next Hitler, I don\u2019t think 3 years from now Trans people will be in concentration camps, I don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s gonna construct leftist gulags. Shits gonna suck, for some groups more than others, but it will pass, we will survive. \n\nPeople gotta remember as dumb and backwards as conservative policy is, 90% of it is just \u201clet\u2019s go back to doing things the way we used to do\u201d. Most anti-trans policy is essentially just rolling shit back to what it was like only 20-30 years ago. Trans people weren\u2019t in concentration camps 20-30 years ago, trans people still had communities 20-30 years ago, movies about trans people existed and received generally positive reception 20-30 years ago. That\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t way worse for trans people back then, it definitively was, but trans people SURVIVED, the inability to get HRT for children didn\u2019t stop trans people from existing or forming communities, trans books not being in schools didn\u2019t prevent kids from growing up to be trans adults, the trans community existed back then and got through it to a better tomorrow. Obviously we wanna do everything we can to prevent rolling back the great progress we\u2019ve made in trans acceptance, but stumbling back a decade or so isn\u2019t the same as \u201cHolocaust 2.0 is 2 years away\u201d. \n\nTrump will suck, it will really suck for certain groups, but we\u2019ll survive and manage. And as much as Trump might try some BS, his maga following is not strong enough to supersede the leftists, liberals, and moderate conservatives, to keep him in power after his second term is over. \n\nAnd if you want hopium, consider that after Trump we are very likely to get an 8 year Democrat. It\u2019s extraordinarily rare for one party to hold the presidency twice in a row outside of two term presidents, so almost guaranteed the next president will be democrat. And after Trump it will have been 12 years since a president served to sequential terms which is a pretty long time to go in comparison to historical trends, so whatever Dem candidate has a very strong chance of getting both terms back to back. And since the Dems almost certain will be using a much younger candidate and hopefully learn a few things from this fiasco, it\u2019s a good chance people will see this new candidate as a course correction and be more interested in them. So your hopium can be that there\u2019s a very strong chance after Trump is done we will have a two term better Dem president that can roll back a lot of what Trump does and put us on a better track to prevent another Trump from happening again.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"&gt; And if you want hopium, consider that after Trump we are very likely to get an 8 year Democrat.\n\nYou're assuming that fair elections will happen after Trump.","role":"user"},{"content":"Yes, I am. \n\nBecause as dumb as some of the recent decisions by the Supreme Court have been, when you actually look at the track record they have they clearly are not purely in the boat of \u201clet conservatives get away with whatever they want to do to voting\u201d, as is the case where this conservative majority multiple Trump appointed judges Supreme Court actually ruled that a southern state districting was racially biased against black people and that the republicans had to redo it. They just as easily coulda said \u201cnah, we don\u2019t see enough evidence to suggest this\u201d, and frankly in regards to districting it\u2019s actually kinda hard to definitively prove motivations so it wouldn\u2019t even have been a stretch to say that, but they still took the case and not only ruled the districting as wrong but specifically ruled it was racially discriminatory. The SC isn\u2019t as blatantly in Trump\u2019s pocket as people assume based on a handful of rulings. \n\nAlso if patterns still hold then Texas will be blue by the time Trump\u2019s term is over regardless of what conservatives try to do and at that point it\u2019s basically game over because Texas has so many electoral votes","role":"assistant"}]}

More than often, you'll realise there are no plots, no schemes and no plans but simply people failing to see the need to change course until it's all too late. The gerontocracy of the party is precisely a symptom of that systemic inertia against calls for news ideas and paradigms, and the old, staunch Democratic voters **love** the party exactly for that.\n\n&gt;I see Biden (and the DNC\u2019s) competition of Biden not from an electability standpoint\n\nLook, do you think we are only now seeing Biden's age? Last year when Biden was in Ireland, he called for the country to \"let's go... lick the world.\"\n\nThat little gaff almost immediately made the rounds on [late night television.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_0f2II1Kty0)\n\nSeriously, do you think most people are blind or something? That guy is fucking ancient, and it's largely his appeal as a familiar face in the party rather than this notion of \"electability\" you're going by that has landed him the top job.\n\nWhether you like it or not, older people do tend to have their preconceived, deeply-entrenched, mostly-unrealistic notions of past normalcy, and it's something you need to keep in mind even when it isn't never articulated anywhere by anyone in any way.\n\n&gt;I do think it was quite obvious (and studied? Maybe?) where the messaging from the liberal media started and stopped.\n\nOK, do you think there was a chance in hell Joe fucking Scarborough would say something nice about Bernie Sanders on camera if not for some alleged memos coming from the very top?\n\nThose are very well-paid television personalities mostly living in the nicer part of New York you are talking about here, for fuck's sake. If you don't expect them to be conservative, just what kind of people do you expect to be conservative? Fucking broke-arse migrant workers?\n\n&gt;Bernie would get less time to talk, had less media reporting, and was criticized far more.\n\nAgain, what your complaint boils down to is the fact that he was a non-establishment member of a political party being sidelined in what was for the most part a game organised and refereed by the establishment. Do you think most people are too stupid to notice Sanders being the odd one out in that whole picture?\n\nAgain, you might as well argue at this point that they didn't realise Biden was fucking old.\n\n&gt; I, very misguidedly, voted for Yang \n\nOK, so your politics was a crock of shit just 4 years ago, and now you think you know everything. Is that what you're trying to tell me?","role":"assistant"}]}

(Obama is the only person in the 2000s to win Wisconsin by more than 1%...)\n\nIn 2016, that exact statement applied to Donald Trump. Polls today suggest 2024 will be similarly close. The get-out-the-vote operations, the so-called \u201cground game,\u201d may determine the outcome in November.\n\nCuz, The Trump campaign is tasking the far-right Turning Point network with spearheading its ground game despite having no track record of success.\n\nCNN reported that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign is taking a vastly different approach to 2024 compared with 2020, with plans for fewer staff and expenses [and instead] relying on wealthy conservative groups for data, infrastructure, and significant bank accounts.\u201d It further noted that one of the most important of these groups  is Charli Kirk\u2019s  group\n\nConservative donors have rewarded the Turning Point network for its virulence with more cash every year. The group reported $9.8 million in donations for 2017, $79.2 million for 2022, and a quarter of a billion since 2016.\n\nBut the ability to vacuum up cash does not automatically translate into the ability to boost voter turnout.\n\nIn 2022, the Turning Point network entered the ground game business, mainly in Arizona, where it is headquartered. As the Arizona Republic reported, \u201cTurning Point PAC, the political action committee started by Turning Point USA, spent $494,105 during the 2022 election cycle, including the primary elections. The bulk of that, $377,201, went towards the general election races for U.S. Senate, governor, and Secretary of State in Arizona.\u201d\n\nTurning Point\u2019s candidates lost all of those races.\n\nKari Lake, led the Democratic nominee, Katie Hobbs, by 2.4 percentage points in the final FiveThirtyEight poll average. Yet Hobbs won by a 0.7 percentage point margin. Underperforming the polls by 3 points indicates that Lake and her Turning Point comrades got beat on the ground.\n\nUndeterred, Turning Point last year began shopping around a $108 million get-out-the-vote plan, now called \u201cChase the Vote,\u201d focusing on Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin.\n\nThen-Chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, gave this plan the cold shoulder. Kirk launched blistering attacks on McDaniel, claiming she was a Democratic plant and urging Trump to dump her. According to Real Clear Politics, McDaniel told Trump that Kirk\u2019s penchant for insulting African Americans, such as saying Martin Luther King, Jr. did not deserve a holiday, would hurt efforts with Black voters.\n\nKirk won the fight. McDaniel quit under pressure. Then Trump took Kirk\u2019s suggestion to install his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as RNC co-chair.\nRepublicans suspicious of Kirk told NBC News soon after McDaniel\u2019s February ouster that Kirk pushed for it so Turning Point could take over the 2024 ground game and profit from it:\n\nAt the \u201cRestoring National Confidence\u201d summit, hosted by Turning Point Action ahead of this month\u2019s RNC winter meetings in Las Vegas, state and local GOP chairs were pitched on transitioning their voter outreach and canvassing efforts to an app created by Superfeed Technologies, a company led by Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer of Turning Point USA.\n\n\u201cThis is why he was trying to get rid of Ronna,\u201d [a] Trump ally said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t make it sound like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re tired of losing. We don\u2019t have an early vote program.\u2019 He should have just said, \u2018Listen, he who controls the RNC controls millions of dollars and I want to get my hands on them.\u2019 I mean, that would have been a more honest grift.\u201d\n\nTrump usually likes to hustle rather than be hustled. What would entice him to fall for Turning Point\u2019s scheme? Probably because \u201cChase the Vote\u201d is premised on a political strategy that comports with Trump\u2019s extremist politics: forget the swing, juice the base.\n\nAs CNN reported: \u201cThe prevailing wisdom of the consultant class before was, \u2018Let\u2019s go to those swing districts and really try and move those voters.\u2019 Well, we don\u2019t agree,\u201d one source familiar with the plans told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re going where the Republicans are. We\u2019re going to drive up [the] score in those areas and get the people that stayed home in 2020 or 2022.\u201d\n\nThis is the logic Turning Point used in 2022 when it struck out in all the major Arizona races. But it\u2019s a comfortable strategy for Trump to accept because he need not woo swing voters.\n\nIn some progressive circles, base-only strategies have been trendy in recent years. But Democratic leaders have largely eschewed such insular thinking and Also courted swing voters, to Combine with Base, which paid off in 2018, 2020, and 2022, Helping in The Suburbs\n\nIf Trump\u2019s ground game grifters ignore the swing, women, Suburbs  they risk ceding a critical voting bloc to Harris . &amp; It Doesn\u2019t Help, If They Can\u2019t Maximize\/Increase their Own Base As well. Despite Trump Getting Shot, His opponent dropping out mid-election , his numbers didn\u2019t move. &amp; Now  His VP is a weird little off-putting gremlin talking about Mt Dew.\n\nTo put the quandary in a nutshell. Trump is a low ceiling\/high floor candidate.\n\nAfter all You Need Base + Swing Voters,Despite a dwindling pool of it\n\n&amp; to Rely on low-engagement, low-education, low-information, particularly male  voters in getting more votes is madness.\n\nAlso Campaigns need air war &amp; ground troops, but to win , you better invest in it early so it\u2019s there when you need it.

And most of them happen to be swing states that are going to be crucial to Republican success in this year\u2019s elections.

It was that enough Democratic voters opted out of the binary where it mattered in 2016, sufficiently lowering the bar for Trump to win.\n\nHillary lost in 2016 despite the polls, Cuz people were lukewarm on both candidates but who would prefer Hillary win, thought (thanks to the media) Trump had zero shot so they didn\u2019t bother voting. Nobody will ever think Trump has zero shot again.\n\nIf you Look at counties in Michigan from 2016-2020. Biden gained a substantial amount of votes in the Detroit metro area and Grand Rapids that far outmatched the increased margins that Trump got from rural counties, in 2020.\n\nIf You Look At Counties in Ohio &amp; North Carolina in 2020. Biden was Over-Performing in Suburban Areas, While Trump Increased his Vote Totals in Rural County, After Rural County.\n\nAlso  This election Only two competitive Goverserhip races this year, North Carolina and New Hampshire. I Think Democrats Will Win Them.\n\nBut I think  the Senate is a brutal map for Democrats.\n\nThree seats being defended by Democrats are in states won by Republican Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020, while there are no seats in this class held by Republicans in states won by Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.  Sherrod Brown Will Win, While West Virginia &amp; Montana are a Loss.\n\nSo The U.S Senate = 51 R 49 D\n\nAlso Republicans won a slim House majority at least in part by winning more victories in districts that Joe Biden carried than Democrats did in districts carried by Donald Trump in 2020 &amp; 2022 .

Past a certain point the Dems are going to have to be better or else shouting Vote Blue No Matter Who will fall on deaf ears.\n\n- Perception of the economy may be all it takes to win or lose an election. 78-year-old senile Trump can defeat a generic Democrat just by claiming things were better under him than under the current administration, and people generally agreeing with that claim. Abortion rights and democracy weren't enough to compete with people's wallets. And when 2028 comes around, whether it's a real election or a sham one, rollback of LGBTQ rights probably won't be able to compete with the wallet either.

We have to understand we are coming from a position where we are politically engaged, this is not the normal voter. They don\u2019t go to twitter to see the chaos, they aren\u2019t here on Reddit talking about it. Our own bubble of political engagement makes us think everyone is like this and they are not trust me. Here are a few anecdotal situations I\u2019ve had in the past two week. These are sum ups of convos\n\nCentrist normie at work. Me- man Biden\u2019s speech was not good hope he can last. Him- doesn\u2019t he always fuck up when he talks, we all knew he was old. I\u2019m still voting for him cuz I like his policies and trump is a nightmare\n\nCentrist right leaning dude I know- him- dude Biden can\u2019t even talk Jesus Christ he is so old he can\u2019t run a country.  Me- were you gonna vote for him before you saw him fall apart during the debate?\n    Him- no I was gonna vote for trump, Biden is too old. Me- so it didn\u2019t matter how well he did. (aggressive argument ensues) \n\nPeople are already set and most vote party line anyways. Let look at it\n\nWe have leftist who see the threat of trump and will vote for a moldy jar of applesauce over trump, so whomever runs democrat has this vote (mine included)\n\nWe have maga\u2026obviously trump\n\nWe have centrist normies. These folks did not watch the UN security counsel meeting or whatever just happened. Most see the threat of trump and his nonsense so I figure they will vote biden\n\nWe have the entitled progressives (and I mean that) who care more about what\u2019s happening in Palestine and have given up on Biden. Which angers me because to put what\u2019s happening in Palestine (which is horrifying and I don\u2019t agree with) over the security of your own country, you are coming from a place of privilege and know the outcome of the election won\u2019t effect you (or so they think) more or less the TYT angle. \n\nWe have independents. Now to even be an independent, a real one. Not the \u201cI\u2019m not democrat or Republican blah blah blah\u201d (those folks are Republican) but a real independent you are way more politically engaged than the average normie. These folks pay attention and they see the trump threat, they know project 2025, they know what has happened with the Supreme Court and they are not pleased. They will either opt out, vote independent or vote biden. But not for trump.\n\nThen we have the silent vote. Females who are either now politically engaged due to roe v wade, or women in conservative homes where it\u2019s all about trump who behind that curtain of the voting booth are gonna vote for whomever the democrat presidential candidate is. \n\nAgain, we are only freaking out cuz we are politically active and watching every moment of Biden on real time. Let\u2019s ask this question. Let\u2019s say Biden didn\u2019t fuck up once in the last two public speeches he made but was still his old ass self. Do we think the criticism wouldn\u2019t have been the same? Would the media and right wing twitter not have gone off on how old he talks regardless of his fuck ups while talking? Let be serious.

Matt financially supports a fellow youtuber that is actively campaigning for government on a platform of making it easier for any citizen to obtain a weapon, including those who should absolutely not be trusted with them. The same type of person it appears the Trump shooter was. The same type of shooter that killed children in Brandon's district. Therefore, Matt cannot act suprised about this.

Most Americans don't speak statistics, they speak their trade and maybe their hobbies if they have any\/can afford them, which most professional statisticians probably don't speak (division of labor and all). We need populist rhetoric and populist policy if we want to convince enough people in MAGA to not vote, or vote for our candidate. \n\nAlso, I hate to say it, but there was definitely a lot of sexism and racism that drove republicans to the polls, so while Kamala was incredible in her ability to learn how to do public speaking at a national level and then debating and national politicking in an unprecedentedly short length of time, indicating she's ridiculously intelligent and good at learning and acting new patterns and roles very quickly which are rare traits seen in the best leaders (I think she has the competency to be a great reformer like FDR), most people are kinda sexist, kinda racist, and dumb enough to refuse to pay attention even if their life depends on it, if it requires more mental effort than TikTok.

The amount of intentionality that goes into all the little things in a generative image is almost always closer to a client who's hired the photographer rather than the photographer themselves. Its a fuzzy line, I'll admit, but its very clear to me that the overwhelming majority of generative images out there on the \"not art\" side of that line.

This has nothing to do with the quality of the image, or how closely it turned out to what the prompter had in their head. The details are not their artistic vision, they are the \"vision\" of an unthinking algorithm.\n\nSo by default, generative images are not art, and a generative image must be proven to be an exception if it is to be considered art.\n\nA photograph, on the other hand, does represent the artistic vision of the photographer. Even if it is a poor or flippant artistic vision, it is still something that exists because a human saw something and thought \"I find this aesthetically pleasing and wish to capture it\", then used a tool to pick it out and isolate it from the broader context they found it in.\n\nSo by default, a photograph is art, and must be proven to be an exception if it is to be considered non-art (ie: the photo was taken by accident or something).\n\nThis isn't a lower standard, its the same standard.
