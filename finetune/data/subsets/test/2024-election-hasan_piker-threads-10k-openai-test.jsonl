That means the black people who learned how to quell the sting of tear gas from Palestinian protesters, can not have solidarity with me. And then it means the feminist groups and LGBTQ groups must deny me to protect themselves as well. \n\nWhen you suggest that we break solidarity with the Palestinian children, you are suggesting complete surrender to fascism. The IDF already trains the NYPD, LAPD, Atlanta PD, and others in their barbaric and sadistic methods, on how to put down dissent and commit genocide. \n\nEvery colonial power has brought the methods developed to keep colonists in line home, and used them against working people in their own countries. \n\nUnlike the rich, our power does not come from money, it does not come from voting. It comes from maintaining universal solidarity among all people who do not own things for living, all who are not capitalist parasites. As soon as you break that solidarity and allow others to be mistreated, you allow yourself to be mistreated. \n\nWorkers allowing minorities or prisoners to be paid less and abused see their own wages fall, because the boss could just hire more abusable workers instead.

Asmon will say he thinks their culture is inferior, Hasan asks if asmon thinks this is justification for genocide, asmon says no. \n\nHasan shouldn\u2019t be accepting the \u2018lesser culture\u2019 framing at all imo, there should be wayy more pushback on that intial frame. We moved away from the term \u2018third world\u2019 because even *that* term was too negatively moralising. Then it moved between underdeveloped and global south. Imo if Asmon wanted to say that Palestinians have *some* aspects of their culture that are underdeveloped, that would be okay. Hasan could then come in and explain how Western colonial oppression of Middle Eastern material conditions has impeded their development. \n\nThen the argument\/solution becomes easy, give them better *support* toward improving material conditions so that these aspects of their culture which are actively impeded have the room to develop. This also gets away from the better\/worse framing. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re better than your poor friend (hopefully) because they aren\u2019t as economically developed.

Hasan has done a lot for me. He's helped me to become a good person.\n\nThis community has been a beacon of growth for me and I'm super grateful.\n\nBut on my journey I eventually stumbled upon the issue of veganism and I donno, I kinda - following a lot of the logic I learned here - thought that vegans were right in a lot of what they were saying.  \nSo I decided to properly check out all of their arguments and watch vegan documentaries and really open myself up to the possibility that vegans might be right, and long story short- I decided that they were, and now I'm a vegan.\n\nAnd I donno.. It's like now that I am, it's like I'm seeing things from a whole new perspective, and I feel like all of the arguments people here make for humans, can be applied to animals, and it just feels like a whole lot of people are preaching about how we should be better, while being complicit in one of the biggest horrors that exists.\n\nI feel like.. Like you know how we call what's going on in Gaza a genocide? Because.. well because it is a genocide. But people who don't get that accuse us of using inflammatory language?  \nBut then vegans will say that what's happening to animals is an animal holocaust. And I feel like that's true. They're literally confined in cages for their entire lives, and then killed. Pigs are literally gassed to death. Like... You don't get more holocaust than that.   \nBut then Hasan dismisses veganism and thinks that vegans are being extra with their views...\n\nI don't know.   \nJust like how it's difficult for you guys to be part of democratic spaces that are in support of what Israel is doing; I too find it hard to be part of this space when you guys are in support of what the meat industry is doing.\n\nI don't if that sounds dumb? But that's how I feel and I'd just like to know what you guys think about this issue.\n\nI'm not really looking to argue or convince anyone to go vegan, but I am wondering why people in this community aren't as a whole opposed to animal farming, and in particular- factory farming.  \nIt's just like- if farming animals causes harm to animals, and there are viable alternatives, then how do you justify eating animal products?\n\nTl;dr: Why aren't you vegan?","role":"user"},{"content":"I like eating different types of food too much to give it up.

I will link the original tweet (which contains sources and way more info) in the comments.\n\n\n*TIMELINE*\n\n\nNovember 19th, 2023\n\nThe Houthi rebels hijack the Galaxy Leader and take its crew hostage. Their stated reason is to disrupt commercial shipping in order to pressure western powers to stop the genocide in Gaza.\n\n\nDecember 6th, 2023\n\nAl Arabiya English reports that the Houthis have turned the Galaxy Leader into a tourist attraction for the Yemeni public. By December 19th, 2023, thousands of Yemenis had visited the ship, according to The New Arab.\n\n\nJanuary 13th, 2024\n\n19 year old Rashid Al-Haddad goes viral for a TikTok he filmed while onboard the Galaxy, now a tourist attraction. TikTok users who were unaware the Galaxy had been opened to the public thought Rashid was a Houthi hijacker. The internet dubs him \u201cthe Hot Houthi\u201d and \u201cTimhouthi Chalomet\u201d.\n\n\nJanuary 16th, 2024\n\nDuring Hasan\u2019s daily stream, a chatter asks if he would be interested in talking to the viral \u201cHot Houthi\u201d of TikTok. Hasan thinks he is a Houthi rebel and wants to ask him about the hijacking. He asks the chatter to set up a call. Another chatter asks Hasan if he is really going to have a Houthi rebel on stream and Hasan says yes. The interview begins, and Hasan immediately asks Rashid if he is a member of Ansarallah. Rashid clarifies that he is just a civilian, and that the ship is open to the public for tourism. Realizing he can\u2019t ask Rashid about the hijacking, Hasan instead asks him about growing up in Yemen, the wars, Palestine, anime, junk food, etc. \n\n*Note* - This context is relevant because it directly addresses the claims that: \na) Hasan changed his story about Rashid.\nb) Hasan \u201cglazed\u201d someone he thought to be a Houthi.\nBoth of these claims are false.\n\n\nJanuary 17th, 2024\n\nThe US State Department releases a statement announcing the decision to designate Ansarallah a terror group, effective 30 days from the statement date.\n\n\n*REGARDING THE HOSTAGES*\n\nRashid has never met the hostages, nor did he claim to have met them.\n\nDuring the interview, Rashid tells Hasan that the captain of the Galaxy is Chinese, and that he (the captain) was hanging out with the Houthis rebels, chewing khat and dancing to music. Note: Rashid did not say that **he** had hung out with the captain, but that the Houthis had. \n\nThe captain of the Galaxy Leader is, in fact, a white Bulgarian man named Lubomir Chanev. The reason Rashid thought the captain was Chinese is because he saw a viral video that falsely claimed to show the Galaxy captain partying with the Houthis. The video shows an Asian man chewing khat at some kind of party.\n\nThe video does not actually show the Galaxy crew or the Houthis. It was a random video of a reception that had been posted on YouTube two years earlier, on March 27, 2022. Remember, the Galaxy was hijacked on November 19th, 2023.\n\nIf Rashid had actually met the ship\u2019s captain, he would have known he isn\u2019t Chinese. Rashid\u2019s words were misinterpreted as saying he personally vibed with the captain. What he actually said was that the Houthis were vibing with the captain.\n\n(Source tweet in comments)","role":"user"},{"content":"Based","role":"assistant"}]}

They both suck, but I think everyone in this sub knows that. I think that the support in both parties for the genocide in Gaza is horrific, especially on the Democratic Party because they claim to care about POC and shit through identity politics but are completely willing to support genocide and expect our votes. But elections in the US aren\u2019t choices between two candidates, they\u2019re choices between two fights. An offensive one and a defensive one. If Kamala is in office, we can actually push her much in the same way the uncommitted voters have, and hopefully will continue to do. I originally heard this line of thinking from one of my friends who is the president of a union. He would fit in with this sub perfectly, and literally identifies as a Marxist-Leninist but he\u2019s still voting for Kamala. Not because he thinks she\u2019s some paragon of working class values or the proletariat but because he\u2019s confident he can improve things in her presidency through both politically and in his organizing campaigns more than he could in a trump presidency. I\u2019m not gonna shame you if you don\u2019t want to vote for Kamala, I\u2019ve been there. But I really think that unfortunately she\u2019s the least shitty option we have for this election.\n\nIf you think you have another view I\u2019d love to hear.

This would be the closest hospital for Sonya to go to if need be and the account user below points out that if something had happened between his wife and Sonya Massey, that may lead into why Sean Grayson also suddenly questioned her mental health. Other points are brought up as well. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/t\/ZPRoAo6Ax\/\n\n--\n\nEdit: PLEASE read through this, I've made some edits to get more information and a summary of events added here in case no one is able to watch the video. This has already started to make it's way onto news stations in other countries. This is by far one of the most horrifying, disgusting, clear as day examples of racial violence by an Officer in this country. Justice for Sonya Massey and her family as Sonya Massey leaves behind two teenage children after this brutal murder. \n\nBodycam footage:\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/U2rMB2fYjuY?si=COjYWinRFRZlpo-k](https:\/\/youtu.be\/U2rMB2fYjuY?si=COjYWinRFRZlpo-k)\n\nVideo summary of events for those who can't watch. The unidentified officer will be referred to as Officer 2:\n\nJuly 6th at around 12:50 a.m., Sonya Massey calls 911 about a possible intruder. Responding officers Sean Grayson (the killer) and an unidentified officer (Officer 2) arrive to scout the property. After finding no evidence, officers head to the porch of the home to talk to Sonya Massey.\n\nOfficers Sean Grayson and Officer 2 have a brief conversation with Sonya Massey about their search of the property. Officers Sean Grayson and Officer 2 are prepared to leave after the brief conversation, noted by Sonya Massey moving to close the screen door and Officer Sean Grayson asking the question \"Can we do anything else for you?\". Sonya Massey responded no.\n\nSean Grayson then stops Sonya from closing the door by asking about her mental health and then asks about the owner of a black vehicle parked in her driveway. Sonya does appear to stumble over her words several times during the discussions. Officer 2 walks away to check the building while Officer Sean Grayson and Sonya Massey continue to talk. Conversation can not be heard as the current perspective is from Officer 2's bodycam.\n\nBoth Officers proceed to enter the home where Sonya is asked to retrieve her Driver's license and vehicle information. Sonya to struggle to find her information. It is here that a generally calm situation quickly turns hostile.\n\nPlease note that up until the aggression starts, the tone of voice between everyone comes across as joking\/friendly. The conversation up to this point proceeds as follows:\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *Points to the kitchen*\n\"Check on the burner, we don't need a fire around here or anything.\"\n\nSonya Massey: *Replies with an okay and moves to the kitchen to put on pot holders, grab the pot, and bring the pot to the kitchen sink. She starts to pour out the pot and you can hear the water loudly sizzle.*\n\nOfficer 2: *Unintelligible speech. Laughs and takes a step away from the kitchen*\n\nSonya Massey: \"Where are you going?\"\n\nOfficer 2 (or Officer Sean Grayson): *laughs*\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: \"Away from the hot steaming water.\"\n\nSonya Massey: \"Away from my hot steaming water?\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: \"Yeah.\"\n\nSonya Massey: *joking tone*\n\"Oh rebuke you in the name of the Jesus\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayon: \"Huh?\"\n\nSonya Massey: \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: \"You better f-ing not or I swear to God I'll f-iing shoot you right in your f-ing face.\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *pulls out his weapon and points it at Sonya.*\n\nSonya Massey: \"Oh- Okay! I'm sorry!\" *Now panicking, drops the pot into the sink and raises her hands with potholders still on. Proceeds to get down on the floor*\n\nSean Grayson: *yelling* \"Drop the f-ing pot!\"\n\nOfficer 2: *pulls out weapon and points it at Sonya Massey*\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *Walks to the entrance of the kitchen towards Sonya Massey, repeats statement*\n\"Drop the f-ing pot\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *Fires 3 rounds into Sonya Massey*\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *enters kitchen a few feet from Sonya Massey*\n\"Drop the f-ing pot now!\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *After some silence, he calls in a wounded female, headshot*.\n\"F-\"\n\nOfficer 2:\n\"I was on I was on\" *reference to bodycam*\n\nOfficer 2: \"I'm gonna go get my kit\" *referring to medkit.*\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *chuckles*\n\"Nah, it's a headshot dude, she's done she's done. You can go get it, but that's a headshot.\"\n\nNote about Officer Sean Grayson proceeds to state that he didn't want to take boiling water to the face and proof of that was the supposed water already at their feet. Please note that at video timestamp 10:30 from the bodycam footage of Sean Grayson, you can watch in clear, plain view, Sonya Massey Drop the pot into the sink and put her hands still holding the potholder onto her head. It is after this that Officer Sean Grayson will continue to yell for Sonya to drop the non-existent pot. \n\nOfficer 2 is noted in articles to have applied pressure to Sonya's wound whereas Officer Sean Grayson coldly states that it's a waste of his medical supplies and does not render any aid. \n\nOfficerr Sean Grayson is also heard on his own video and noted in articles, after the shooting, speaking to other officers. Sean remarks to them statements such as \"This f***ing b*tch is crazy\" and \"She set it up on purpose...I didn't have a choice.\"\n\n--\n\nThis is my transcript from what I watched, PBS has a fantastic transcript down below:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/show\/activists-demand-reform-and-justice-after-deputy-shoots-and-kills-sonya-massey-in-her-home\n\n--\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n1.) Family states they were told the wounds were self-inflicted and were not alerted that an officer had been involved in the shooting.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nprillinois.org\/springfield-il\/2024-07-23\/crump-doj-will-investigate-sonya-massey-shooting\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/article\/2024\/jul\/23\/sonya-massey-killing-police-cover-up\n\n2.) Summer Massey  (Sonya's Daughter) states that her mother was previously diagnosed with Schizopheria with paranoia. That said, Sonya was never a threat and this also goes to show that officers STILL do not understand how to handle potential mental health situations.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.illinoistimes.com\/news-opinion\/sonya-masseys-family-calls-for-jack-campbell-to-resign-18829965\n\n3.) Since 2020, Sean Grayson has been employed through 6 different police agencies, with a mixture of those being full-time and part-time positions. That's an average of 1.5 jobs per year (6 months or less at each agency). Grayson was also knowingly hired with Two DUI's on his record.\n\nhttps:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/wireStory\/records-show-deputy-charged-sonya-masseys-fatal-shooting-112208930\n ","role":"user"},{"content":"Look at the tattoo on that piece of shit\u2019s arm.

I\u2019m a little shocked at how much ground Hasan gave asmon. This premise they are arguing from is essentially that Palestine has inferior culture but Hasan is imploring asmon as to *why* that is. Asmon will say he thinks their culture is inferior, Hasan asks if asmon thinks this is justification for genocide, asmon says no. \n\nHasan shouldn\u2019t be accepting the \u2018lesser culture\u2019 framing at all imo, there should be wayy more pushback on that intial frame. We moved away from the term \u2018third world\u2019 because even *that* term was too negatively moralising. Then it moved between underdeveloped and global south. Imo if Asmon wanted to say that Palestinians have *some* aspects of their culture that are underdeveloped, that would be okay. Hasan could then come in and explain how Western colonial oppression of Middle Eastern material conditions has impeded their development. \n\nThen the argument\/solution becomes easy, give them better *support* toward improving material conditions so that these aspects of their culture which are actively impeded have the room to develop. This also gets away from the better\/worse framing. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re better than your poor friend (hopefully) because they aren\u2019t as economically developed. Hasan touched on some of this, but he could have done more to shut down the better\/worse framing imo.","role":"user"},{"content":"The fact that Palestine is being compared to Saudi fucking Arabia is pissing me the the FUCK OFF.

I'm not even going to get started with how they treat women and workers out there.

One guy even discussed how they raped his friend when he was 10 and then completely shaved his hair off. You'll also read stories of women completely terrified of the harassment they received from grown men following them and terrorising them because they didn't like the way they were wearing their headscarves. \n\nOne of the most famous stories is the girl's school fire incident where Mutawas's (religious police) ordered the male fire fighters to not go into the school to avoid \"free mixing\" and because many of the fleeing girls weren't wearing the niqab\/burka resulting in the deaths of many school girls. Here's the [Human Rights Watch report about this.](https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/news\/2002\/03\/14\/saudi-arabia-religious-police-role-school-fire-criticized) **So I absolutely believe when my family members discussed seeing lynchings with canes by these thugs if you weren't at home or in the mosque praying on a Friday**. \n\nThe \"Matawa\" a.k.a 'religious police' were only \"stripped of their powers\" in 2016, although they still operate in Saudi Arabia.

She can be heard asking for police to come to her home as she can hear someone banging on her house. As you will notice in the video, not only was Sean Grayson and Officer 2 banging around the house, but Sonya was still on the phone even up to when the murder was taking place. Speculation based on this fact and others was that Sean Grayson was there before any officers were actually dispatched. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2024\/07\/22\/body-cam-deputy-charged-sonya-massey\/\n\nThis user has done some research regarding Sean Grayson's wife who works at a hospital 8 minutes from Sonya Massey's home. This would be the closest hospital for Sonya to go to if need be and the account user below points out that if something had happened between his wife and Sonya Massey, that may lead into why Sean Grayson also suddenly questioned her mental health. Other points are brought up as well. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/t\/ZPRoAo6Ax\/\n\n--\n\nEdit: PLEASE read through this, I've made some edits to get more information and a summary of events added here in case no one is able to watch the video.

This is by far one of the most horrifying, disgusting, clear as day examples of racial violence by an Officer in this country. Justice for Sonya Massey and her family as Sonya Massey leaves behind two teenage children after this brutal murder. \n\nBodycam footage:\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/U2rMB2fYjuY?si=COjYWinRFRZlpo-k](https:\/\/youtu.be\/U2rMB2fYjuY?si=COjYWinRFRZlpo-k)\n\nVideo summary of events for those who can't watch. The unidentified officer will be referred to as Officer 2:\n\nJuly 6th at around 12:50 a.m., Sonya Massey calls 911 about a possible intruder. Responding officers Sean Grayson (the killer) and an unidentified officer (Officer 2) arrive to scout the property. After finding no evidence, officers head to the porch of the home to talk to Sonya Massey.\n\nOfficers Sean Grayson and Officer 2 have a brief conversation with Sonya Massey about their search of the property. Officers Sean Grayson and Officer 2 are prepared to leave after the brief conversation, noted by Sonya Massey moving to close the screen door and Officer Sean Grayson asking the question \"Can we do anything else for you?\". Sonya Massey responded no.\n\nSean Grayson then stops Sonya from closing the door by asking about her mental health and then asks about the owner of a black vehicle parked in her driveway. Sonya does appear to stumble over her words several times during the discussions. Officer 2 walks away to check the building while Officer Sean Grayson and Sonya Massey continue to talk. Conversation can not be heard as the current perspective is from Officer 2's bodycam.\n\nBoth Officers proceed to enter the home where Sonya is asked to retrieve her Driver's license and vehicle information. Sonya to struggle to find her information. It is here that a generally calm situation quickly turns hostile.\n\nPlease note that up until the aggression starts, the tone of voice between everyone comes across as joking\/friendly. The conversation up to this point proceeds as follows:\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *Points to the kitchen*\n\"Check on the burner, we don't need a fire around here or anything.\"\n\nSonya Massey: *Replies with an okay and moves to the kitchen to put on pot holders, grab the pot, and bring the pot to the kitchen sink. She starts to pour out the pot and you can hear the water loudly sizzle.*\n\nOfficer 2: *Unintelligible speech. Laughs and takes a step away from the kitchen*\n\nSonya Massey: \"Where are you going?\"\n\nOfficer 2 (or Officer Sean Grayson): *laughs*\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: \"Away from the hot steaming water.\"\n\nSonya Massey: \"Away from my hot steaming water?\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: \"Yeah.\"\n\nSonya Massey: *joking tone*\n\"Oh rebuke you in the name of the Jesus\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayon: \"Huh?\"\n\nSonya Massey: \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: \"You better f-ing not or I swear to God I'll f-iing shoot you right in your f-ing face.\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *pulls out his weapon and points it at Sonya.*\n\nSonya Massey: \"Oh- Okay! I'm sorry!\" *Now panicking, drops the pot into the sink and raises her hands with potholders still on. Proceeds to get down on the floor*\n\nSean Grayson: *yelling* \"Drop the f-ing pot!\"\n\nOfficer 2: *pulls out weapon and points it at Sonya Massey*\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *Walks to the entrance of the kitchen towards Sonya Massey, repeats statement*\n\"Drop the f-ing pot\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *Fires 3 rounds into Sonya Massey*\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *enters kitchen a few feet from Sonya Massey*\n\"Drop the f-ing pot now!\"\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *After some silence, he calls in a wounded female, headshot*.\n\"F-\"\n\nOfficer 2:\n\"I was on I was on\" *reference to bodycam*\n\nOfficer 2: \"I'm gonna go get my kit\" *referring to medkit.*\n\nOfficer Sean Grayson: *chuckles*\n\"Nah, it's a headshot dude, she's done she's done. You can go get it, but that's a headshot.\"\n\nNote about Officer Sean Grayson proceeds to state that he didn't want to take boiling water to the face and proof of that was the supposed water already at their feet. Please note that at video timestamp 10:30 from the bodycam footage of Sean Grayson, you can watch in clear, plain view, Sonya Massey Drop the pot into the sink and put her hands still holding the potholder onto her head. It is after this that Officer Sean Grayson will continue to yell for Sonya to drop the non-existent pot. \n\nOfficer 2 is noted in articles to have applied pressure to Sonya's wound whereas Officer Sean Grayson coldly states that it's a waste of his medical supplies and does not render any aid. \n\nOfficerr Sean Grayson is also heard on his own video and noted in articles, after the shooting, speaking to other officers. Sean remarks to them statements such as \"This f***ing b*tch is crazy\" and \"She set it up on purpose...I didn't have a choice.\"\n\n--\n\nThis is my transcript from what I watched, PBS has a fantastic transcript down below:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/show\/activists-demand-reform-and-justice-after-deputy-shoots-and-kills-sonya-massey-in-her-home\n\n--\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n1.)

Summer Massey  (Sonya's Daughter) states that her mother was previously diagnosed with Schizopheria with paranoia. That said, Sonya was never a threat and this also goes to show that officers STILL do not understand how to handle potential mental health situations.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.illinoistimes.com\/news-opinion\/sonya-masseys-family-calls-for-jack-campbell-to-resign-18829965\n\n3.) Since 2020, Sean Grayson has been employed through 6 different police agencies, with a mixture of those being full-time and part-time positions. That's an average of 1.5 jobs per year (6 months or less at each agency).

She needs a Veep who won't be a possible hindrance for her Electoral College chances and who maybe can be a governing partner (something she reportedly wants).\n\nVetting is reportedly over and it's just the interviews left. Depending on how those go, it would seem Minnesota Governor Tim Walz should be the most likely Veep pick, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear should be the second-most likely Veep pick.\n\nI also give the edge to Governor Walz because if the Harris Administration manages to win the Election and win Reelection, Governor Walz would be 68 years old and that leaves the Democratic field relatively open for a primary challenge.

I\u2019m reposting their evidence here in hopes lurkers from the H3 community will let Ethan know he got duped by dummies like Destiny. The timeline of events is below. I will link the tweet (which contains sources and way more info) in the comments.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Timeline \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nNovember 19th, 2023\n\nThe Houthi rebels hijack the Galaxy Leader and take its crew hostage. Their stated reason is to disrupt commercial shipping in order to pressure western powers to stop the genocide in Gaza.\n\nDecember 6th, 2023\n\nAl Arabiya English reports that the Houthis have turned the Galaxy Leader into a tourist attraction for the Yemeni public. By December 19th, 2023, thousands of Yemenis had visited the ship, according to The New Arab.\n\nJanuary 13th, 2024\n\n19 year old Rashid Al-Haddad goes viral for a TikTok he filmed while onboard the Galaxy, now a tourist attraction. TikTok users who were unaware the Galaxy had been opened to the public thought Rashid was a Houthi hijacker. The internet dubs him \u201cthe Hot Houthi\u201d and \u201cTimhouthi Chalomet\u201d.\n\nJanuary 16th, 2024\n\nDuring Hasan\u2019s daily stream, a chatter asks if he would be interested in talking to the viral \u201cHot Houthi\u201d of TikTok. Hasan thinks he is a Houthi rebel and wants to ask him about the hijacking. He asks the chatter to set up a call. Another chatter asks Hasan if he is really going to have a Houthi rebel on stream and Hasan says yes. The interview begins, and Hasan immediately asks Rashid if he is a member of Ansarallah. Rashid clarifies that he is just a civilian, and that the ship is open to the public for tourism. Realizing he can\u2019t ask Rashid about the hijacking, Hasan instead asks him about growing up in Yemen, the wars, Palestine, anime, junk food, etc.\n\nJanuary 17th, 2024\n\nThe US State Department releases a statement announcing the decision to designate Ansarallah a terror group, effective 30 days from the statement date.\n\nRegarding the hostages:\n\nRashid has never met the hostages, nor did he claim to have met them.\n\nDuring the interview, Rashid tells Hasan that the captain of the Galaxy is Chinese, and that he (the captain) was hanging out with the Houthis rebels, chewing khat and dancing to music. Note: Rashid did not say that **he** had hung out with the captain, but that the Houthis had. \n\nThe captain of the Galaxy Leader is, in fact, a white Bulgarian man named Lubomir Chanev. The reason Rashid thought the captain was Chinese is because he saw a viral video that falsely claimed to show the Galaxy captain partying with the Houthis. The video shows an Asian man chewing khat at some kind of party.\n\nThe video does not actually show the Galaxy crew or the Houthis. It was a random video of a reception that had been posted on YouTube two years earlier, on March 27, 2022. Remember, the Galaxy was hijacked on November 19th, 2023.\n\nIf Rashid had actually met the ship\u2019s captain, he would have known he isn\u2019t Chinese. Rashid\u2019s words were misinterpreted as saying he personally vibed with the captain. What he actually said was that the Houthis were vibing with the captain.\n\n(Source tweet in comments)","role":"user"},{"content":"https:\/\/x.com\/diorgoblin\/status\/1850296993584693320?s=46&amp;t=TH_1tGYdQv0Dx5x0__QCyA","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Extremely thorough work https:\/\/x.com\/diorgoblin\/status\/1848817106629861732?s=46&amp;t=TH_1tGYdQv0Dx5x0__QCyA","role":"user"}]}

Vance, Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts rails against birth control, IVF, abortion, childlessness, and dog parks","role":"user"},{"content":"**Article transcript:**\n\n&gt;*Media Matters* has obtained a galley copy of Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book, *Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington To Save America*. \\[The book was formerly titled *A Time for Fighting: Taking Back America From the Ground Up*.\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The book recently garnered headlines due to Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance's foreword, in which he lauds the stature and influence of Heritage, and suggests that his agenda can act as an \"essential weapon\" in the \"fights that lay ahead\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the copy reviewed by *Media Matters*, Roberts, who is the architect of Heritage-led initiative Project 2025, rails against birth control, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and abortion. He says that having children should not be considered an \"optional individual choice\", but \"a social expectation or a transcendent gift\". He describes \"contraceptive technologies\" as \"revolutionary inventions that shape American culture away from abundance, marriage, and family\". He labels reproductive choice methods as a \"snake strangling the American family\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From page 63: *\"We need to understand what could be called contraceptive technologies\u2014revolutionary inventions that shape American culture away from abundance, marriage, and family\u2014in the same vein. They shift norms, incentives, and choices, often invisibly and involuntarily. Conservatives inveigh against no-fault divorce, the Sexual Revolution, and the destruction of a culture of hope without recognizing that these cultural changes are all downstream of technological ones.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"If you change a culture on a profound level, you can break the most basic functioning elements of civilization,\"* Roberts continues. *\"In the case of contraceptives, we are a society remade according to a research agenda set by the Party of Destruction.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Roberts also attacks in vitro fertilization. From page 64: *\"Once you understand this pattern (individual choice masking cultural upheaval), you will see it everywhere. In vitro fertilization (IVF) seems to assist fertility, but has the added effect of incentivizing women to delay trying to start a family, often leading to added problems when the time comes.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Roberts blames contraception for a rise in abortion rates. Also from page 64: *\"As other kinds of contraceptive technologies spread, abortion rates went up, not down. Why? Because technological change made having a child seem like an optional, and not natural result of having sex, and destroyed a whole series of institutions and cultural norms that had protected women and forced men to take responsibility for their actions.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Roberts rails against childlessness as well, which has increasingly become a political problem for Republicans amid outrage over Vance's history of misogynist comments about \"childless cat ladies\". From page 47:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"That's a problem, because a childless society becomes decadent and nostalgic. Aging, barren societies literally become consumptive, taking on higher levels of debt and depleting savings as they pay foreign workers to keep things going. They become less and less capable of innovation (a young person\u2019s game), and more and more stuck and decrepit every year. Their traditions, culture, and way of life die out, with nothing to hand on, and no one to hand it on to. A culture of childlessness is, in the final analysis, a culture of despair.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"Getting married and having kids, on the other hand, gives you skin in the game for the future of your country. It forces you to grow up, give up childish things, and live in the real world. It grounds you, gives you a sense of purpose in life, and helps generate community, gratitude, and joy. A culture of children is a culture of hope.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On page 69, Roberts rails against the Swampoodle dog park in Washington, D.C., for having too much room for dogs to play, and not enough for children, blaming this on *\"the antifamily culture shaping legislation, regulation, and enforcement throughout our sprawling government\"*.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Many of these comments echo anti-choice positions taken by Project 2025 and its partner organizations. The Project 2025 policy book, titled *Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise*, recommends a potential Trump-Vance administration to attack reproductive rights from several angles, including by removing the term \"abortion\" from all federal laws and regulations, reversing abortion pill approval, punishing providers by withdrawing federal health funding, and restricting clinics that provide contraception and STD testing. Members of the initiative's advisory board go significantly further, advocating for extreme abortion bans and criticizing IVF.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trump's campaign has recently sought to distance itself from Heritage and Project 2025 as the initiative becomes a toxic election issue, and polling indicates its extremism is unpopular with voters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yet the former president is closely aligned with Heritage and its initiative: Trump previously gushed over Roberts as \"so incredible\" during a 2022 speech at The Heritage Foundation; Paul Dans, the former director of Project 2025, said that Heritage has a \"great\" relationship with the former president, and he is \"very bought in with this\"; 31 of the 38 core authors and editors of Project 2025's *Mandate for Leadership* worked in the Trump administration, and Roberts confirmed to *The New York Times* in April 2023 that \"Heritage and its project partners have already briefed Mr. Trump\" on Project 2025.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As for Vance, his connections to Roberts, the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025, and its partner organizations also run deep \u2014 the GOP vice presidential nominee praised Heritage's president earlier this year as \"somebody I rely on a lot who has very good advice, very good political instincts\". Vance's foreword to *Dawn's Early Light* also celebrates Roberts, and calls Heritage \"the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump\", and proceeds from the book's sales will partly benefit the right-wing think tank.\n\nAlso see:\n\n* [\"J.D. Vance wrote the foreword to the book of Project 2025 architect Kevin Roberts \u2014 and proceeds will benefit his organization \"](https:\/\/www.mediamatters.org\/heritage-foundation\/jd-vance-wrote-foreword-book-project-2025-architect-kevin-roberts-and-proceeds)\n* [\"Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts: Project 2025 framework will carry on for the next 10 years\"](https:\/\/www.mediamatters.org\/project-2025\/heritage-foundation-president-kevin-roberts-project-2025-framework-will-carry-next-10)","role":"assistant"}]}

Yet since the admin uses the west bank label\u2014 the facts get obscured when nobody is sticking up for the truth when there\u2019s literal video evidence that he says \u201cJudea and Samaria\u201d \n\nHE wanted to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem in 1984. It was HIM, who used his leverage to force the US presidents to bend over for IS. He made sure Israel was protected and got all the funding, weapons and economic gifts they \u201cneeded\u201d. Yet he\u2019s getting called the most anti Israel Us President in history.\n\nThis mf pos was saying Iraq had\/was about to obtain nuclear weapons that they would point at Israel in 1981!!!

He came up with the America and Israel are best friends thing. Hes the one who used diplomatic pressures to get Bibi out of trouble time and time again.\n\nHe won\u2019t even refer to Rabin as a \u201cformer prime minister\u201d.

He was close with every prime minister (besides Naftali Bennett, they hate eachother but idk why) yet won\u2019t even refer to Rabin as one. \n\nHe has long vowed that there will never be a \u201cunilaterally recognized Palestinian state\u201d and implied they need to surrender and come to the negotiating table.\n\nHe said Hamas needs to be eliminated (and other phrases implying he has the same goal as Bibi) this whole operation in the north is so hamas cant \u201creconstitute\u201d\/\u201creconvene\u201d \n\nThe Rafah operation didnt cross Bidens red lines\u2014 yet these mofos are acting like the time period leading up to that was spent with US intel helping locate the hostages, was Biden tying Israel\u2019s hands\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\n\nBiden forced MBS to back out of BRICS and to wait on the sidelines for the deal w\/ Israel.\n\nIt seems like the Evangelicals have built such a monster that theyve been able to use their leverage to further radicalize Israel to the point where Bibi looks like a moderate amongst radical extremists who want to build the 3rd temple. The american zio conglomerate is lobbying Israel at this point!!!\n\nThe ME and especially Palestinians have suffered millions and millions of losses because of JOSEPH ROBINETTE BIDEN JR&amp; he doesn\u2019t even get credit for it. \n\nThe fairytale creation of the state of israel that he espouses is disgusting.

Hasan has done a lot for me. He's helped me to become a good person.\n\nThis community has been a beacon of growth for me and I'm super grateful.\n\nBut on my journey I eventually stumbled upon the issue of veganism and I donno, I kinda - following a lot of the logic I learned here - thought that vegans were right in a lot of what they were saying.  \nSo I decided to properly check out all of their arguments and watch vegan documentaries and really open myself up to the possibility that vegans might be right, and long story short- I decided that they were, and now I'm a vegan.\n\nAnd I donno.. It's like now that I am, it's like I'm seeing things from a whole new perspective, and I feel like all of the arguments people here make for humans, can be applied to animals, and it just feels like a whole lot of people are preaching about how we should be better, while being complicit in one of the biggest horrors that exists.\n\nI feel like.. Like you know how we call what's going on in Gaza a genocide? Because.. well because it is a genocide. But people who don't get that accuse us of using inflammatory language?  \nBut then vegans will say that what's happening to animals is an animal holocaust. And I feel like that's true. They're literally confined in cages for their entire lives, and then killed. Pigs are literally gassed to death. Like... You don't get more holocaust than that.   \nBut then Hasan dismisses veganism and thinks that vegans are being extra with their views...\n\nI don't know.   \nJust like how it's difficult for you guys to be part of democratic spaces that are in support of what Israel is doing; I too find it hard to be part of this space when you guys are in support of what the meat industry is doing.\n\nI don't if that sounds dumb? But that's how I feel and I'd just like to know what you guys think about this issue.\n\nI'm not really looking to argue or convince anyone to go vegan, but I am wondering why people in this community aren't as a whole opposed to animal farming, and in particular- factory farming.  \nIt's just like- if farming animals causes harm to animals, and there are viable alternatives, then how do you justify eating animal products?\n\nTl;dr: Why aren't you vegan?","role":"user"},{"content":"I thought the same &amp; then got humbled by my own digestive system.

To some extent, I think that's to be expected, as we all knew Biden isn't really capable of being the president of a country right now*. However, this isn't in line with what the people in this subreddit actually say.\n\nWhenever there is the discussion as to whether voting for democrats or for an anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist or working class candidate, there used to be people advocating for voting democrat in the subreddit, but not nearly as much as now. And here's what's most curious: these people never actually say anything regarding Kamala, they just say things regarding trump and the republicans and project 2025. So that got me thinking, if these are the main points here, and if that hasn't changed at all since Biden dropped out, what is the actual cause of the change in this subreddit's posture regarding the elections and the democrats? Why has the change in candidate, from reelection of the current president to the election of the current vice president made people go from \"maybe we should try to change things for the better for once\" to \"Vote democrat or else you'll be a literal chattel slave!!!\"\n\n\n\n *Although Biden clearly doesn't have the mental capacity to be a country's president, that hasn't really affected the way the country is run. That's because in the USA, politics aren't made by just one personality in government doing things he thinks are right. They are made by a party and by the party's donors. For example, Biden doesn't understand the geopolitical rivalry between the USA and China, yet still announced a 100% tax on EVs cause it would be beneficial to USA billionaires (main donors) such as Elon musk, whose company Tesla can't compete with Chinese EVs.","role":"user"},{"content":"It's definitely a campaign.

The only other time I was ever told I deserved to die for not voting for x candidate was when Dems called me and asked me to\nvote for Biden last election and I said I didn't vote for cops or warmongers. The guy *screamed* at me about how I deserved to be killed by Trump and then hung up on me. These posts strike me the same kind of panicked guilt-tripping, over-emotional cord as that lol. \n\n\nIt's extremely divisive and inappropriate considering, you know, a fucking live-streamed genocide.

Look that's subjective and you can really only judge that down the road. They're going on and on about him doing a great job and such, but they ignore the public at large. They think it's some MAGA worldview and media bias, but he hasn't been popular. But the public at large is not happy with him and it's not just MAGA people...it's not just been since the debate. \n\nI think the Dems just blowing it off as a \"Biden is old and media is unfair\" tactic and honestly are thinking just subbing in Kamala will be the quick fix....they're really short-sighted. The type of people excited about voting for Kamala are already voting for Biden anyways. The only thing she can do is just not be as old and slightly do better against Trump....but again Dems should beat Trump by huge margins. And the fact that we're putting in a VP that was so bad that she couldn't make the primary in 2020....she's never won a single primary. She's never run an election outside of California. 2020 was a COVID year.\n\nWhy is there 0 discussion about the fact that he's been unpopular the entirety of his presidency. You can only do so much by saying \"The other guy is worse!\" because when you're actually doing the job....people can see things. He talks about legislation he's passed...well it's weird how Pelosi\/Schumer were the ones that actually passed that and not him. The economic numbers were better...but that was a natural bounce after COVID shut downs and people going back to work. They've blown off inflation and tried to use Republican talking points about how the economy is great for Wall Street so inflation isn't an issue. \n\nFor the most part, his approval ratings were bad since the end of his first year. That's 55%-60% of the country that is not approving of his job for his entire time in office. 35-40% is generally just mainly democratic base voters. If you say that Trump's hardcore base is 40% of the electorate, that means Independents...the ones that swing elections....they do not think he's doing a good job.\n\nHonestly, he was a weak candidate in 2020 and if not for COVID he probably would've lost. (Which would've been better for Dems overall in house\/senate elections) and almost lost in 2020. He talks about the 2022 mid-terms and not being a redwave....but does not point out that in 2018 the Dems had 235 Seats and by 2022 they were down to 213 Seats and the GOP still won the House....20' &amp; 22' elections he was the Dem leader and the Dems lost the house.\n\nBiden's approval rating based on the 538 aggregate model has had Biden's DISAPPROVAL RATING at over 50% (majority) since November 11th, 2021, not even a year into office.\n\nToday his approval rating is a 36.8% in their model, for reference at the same time in their Presidency...\n\nTrump was at 40.2% at this point...which was in the middle of COVID and the George Floyd Protests. Trump was at 38% at his worst at the end of his time....after January 6th. He's more unpopular than Trump was after January 6th and COVID.\n\nEvery time critiques of him are brought up it's always \"Oh you're voting for Trump?\" and that's been their trick. He was able to sell Dems on his electability based on polls against Donald Trump who is unpopular himself. Biden would be losing to Bob Dole, John McCain, or Mitt Romney level Republicans. They can say he's a great President and all...but the public at large does not believe it.

I am new to this subreddit, but listening to Hasan mention Ethan Klein\u2019s audience being progressive is something that made me want to write here. I don\u2019t know if Hasan will read it, but I\u2019m sure other fallen H3 fans that are here will understand. \n\nI was a fan of Ethan\u2019s for a decade now. I started when he was still actively uploading his .exe videos. I followed the Kleins through the years and then their podcast started. I absolutely loved it. I was all for it, but then an event happened that I\u2019m sure all the fallen fans from old H3 days will understand. \n\nJordan Peterson.\n\nI remember the day this podcast episode was uploaded and I remember being like\u2026what the fuck is Ethan doing? It made me take a break. I realized that as more stuff came out, I didn\u2019t agree with him.\n\nThen, he had what seemed to me, a genuine change of heart and came back stronger. He cultivated a massively queer, autistic, liberal\/leftist audience. October 7th was truly when the dissonance began. \n\nHasan couldn\u2019t be any more right when he said that H3 fans had to ACTIVELY not think about his views. If I could just push that from my mind, it was fine. It was funny and I could enjoy it but it was always there in the back of my mind. Then, it kept getting worse, somehow??\n\nEthan truly lost me the day he mocked Aaron Bushnell. \u201cHe was really good at dying.\u201d It was so fucking disrespectful and ignorant that I remember feeling nauseous. This content creator that I once really enjoyed to support and hear their opinions was suddenly so opposite of what I fundamentally believed that continuing to watch felt like willingly chewing glass. \n\nSo, here I am, and Ethan would say that I\u2019m just a \u201csnarker\u201d or god forbid one of Hasan\u2019s Anti Semitic Thralls. \n\nHe refuses to listen to anyone that doesn\u2019t explicitly agree with him and as a fan who saw him have a genuine change of heart and was REALLY holding out hope for this one, I just don\u2019t think Ethan is there yet. \n\nAnyways this was super long but Hasan talking about this felt pretty vindicating and like someone finally understands what it was like to be a longtime H3 fan and to have to come to terms with him being a Zionist. Peace and Love to all my other fallen fans, I see you girlies. \u2764\ufe0f ","role":"user"},{"content":"As a long time, on and off watcher of H3, and a newer(few years) but consistent watcher of Hasan's, you put this really well. A lot of times watching H3 I had to actively put aside my views, and as you mentioned with Bushnell, what felt like my morals. It made me feel gross, especially when he would react so harshly to any mention of Zionism. I wish he would have had an anti-zionist Jew on the show a long time ago, it would give him a much needed perspective.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Exactly. I would tune in just here and there for a few minutes after, but I couldn\u2019t get what he said about Bushnell out of my head and I never will.

Hasan has done a lot for me. He's helped me to become a good person.\n\nThis community has been a beacon of growth for me and I'm super grateful.\n\nBut on my journey I eventually stumbled upon the issue of veganism and I donno, I kinda - following a lot of the logic I learned here - thought that vegans were right in a lot of what they were saying.  \nSo I decided to properly check out all of their arguments and watch vegan documentaries and really open myself up to the possibility that vegans might be right, and long story short- I decided that they were, and now I'm a vegan.\n\nAnd I donno.. It's like now that I am, it's like I'm seeing things from a whole new perspective, and I feel like all of the arguments people here make for humans, can be applied to animals, and it just feels like a whole lot of people are preaching about how we should be better, while being complicit in one of the biggest horrors that exists.\n\nI feel like.. Like you know how we call what's going on in Gaza a genocide? Because.. well because it is a genocide. But people who don't get that accuse us of using inflammatory language?  \nBut then vegans will say that what's happening to animals is an animal holocaust. And I feel like that's true. They're literally confined in cages for their entire lives, and then killed. Pigs are literally gassed to death. Like... You don't get more holocaust than that.   \nBut then Hasan dismisses veganism and thinks that vegans are being extra with their views...\n\nI don't know.   \nJust like how it's difficult for you guys to be part of democratic spaces that are in support of what Israel is doing; I too find it hard to be part of this space when you guys are in support of what the meat industry is doing.\n\nI don't if that sounds dumb? But that's how I feel and I'd just like to know what you guys think about this issue.\n\nI'm not really looking to argue or convince anyone to go vegan, but I am wondering why people in this community aren't as a whole opposed to animal farming, and in particular- factory farming.  \nIt's just like- if farming animals causes harm to animals, and there are viable alternatives, then how do you justify eating animal products?\n\nTl;dr: Why aren't you vegan?","role":"user"},{"content":"My honest number 1 reason is meat tastes good.\n\n\nSecond meals options would have to change so much for me that I wouldn't even know where to begin.

And clinicians tend to develop a very disease-focused, doctor-patient, or expert-supplicant point of view of their work. This is present in the language of psychiatric and CBT literature, where there is very objectivism based language used as opposed to the more interpretivist language you see in the psychodynamic and existential-humanistic literature. A very interesting place you can find a break with this sort of language use (and thus conceptualization of people in general) is in the work of anthropologist and psychoanalytic researcher Kevin groark, whose work you can largely find free on Google scholar, as groark encourages a more phenomenological and intersubjective, rather than positivist and objectivist view of people. Not to mention, the Lacanians have been doing this since like the 50s, applying this sort of thought to social work and critical theory, but groarks work is really interesting in bringing culture into the mix.","role":"user"}]}

And that at least some of those choices are even less electable than POTUS Biden.\n* AOC's concern about Court challenges may be based on if POTUS Joe Biden is forced out as Nominee rather than his deciding to 'bow out' before the Democratic National Convention nominates him.\n\nOverall, it wasn't actually a rant.

I\u2019m a little shocked at how much ground Hasan gave asmon. This premise they are arguing from is essentially that Palestine has inferior culture but Hasan is imploring asmon as to *why* that is. Asmon will say he thinks their culture is inferior, Hasan asks if asmon thinks this is justification for genocide, asmon says no. \n\nHasan shouldn\u2019t be accepting the \u2018lesser culture\u2019 framing at all imo, there should be wayy more pushback on that intial frame. We moved away from the term \u2018third world\u2019 because even *that* term was too negatively moralising. Then it moved between underdeveloped and global south. Imo if Asmon wanted to say that Palestinians have *some* aspects of their culture that are underdeveloped, that would be okay. Hasan could then come in and explain how Western colonial oppression of Middle Eastern material conditions has impeded their development. \n\nThen the argument\/solution becomes easy, give them better *support* toward improving material conditions so that these aspects of their culture which are actively impeded have the room to develop. This also gets away from the better\/worse framing. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re better than your poor friend (hopefully) because they aren\u2019t as economically developed. Hasan touched on some of this, but he could have done more to shut down the better\/worse framing imo.","role":"user"},{"content":"You're right and I am finding this whole conversation frustrating.

Her biggest achievement during Trump administration was the report about sex trafficking around the world.

My siblings and I were raised catholic, went to catholic school, had a confirmation, but really never believed in\/cared about god.  Most of my dad\u2019s family isn\u2019t really religious, we would observe some of the more major holidays, but it was really more of just a family get together than all that religious.  My cousins on that side were raised a little more in Jewish traditions, went to Hebrew school and got their bar mitzvahs that kind of stuff.  I grew up a lot closer to my moms family, we lived in the same neighborhoods and I would really only see my dads family on holidays.  Even though we weren\u2019t close, I have always considered them lovely\/ empathetic people and they are fairly progressive people in most aspects.  Israel isn\u2019t something that I ever really remember being discussed as a kid, I didn\u2019t even know \u201cbirth right trips\u201d were a thing I guess that I was eligible to do.  I basically have no idea what their stances on the current.  \n\nI personally find the Israeli government to be awful and quite frankly wish it never came into existence.  As I said I\u2019m really not the smartest person and I don\u2019t pretend to know know the intricacies of either a one state solution vs 2 state solution, but my kinda dumb bullshit thinking is just whatever causes the fewest deaths\/displacements.  My partner is very tapped into the current situation and is very anti Israel.\n\n\nHaving said all that, there\u2019s a family party coming up that I would like to go to (haven\u2019t seen some people in a really long time), but I\u2019m honestly kinda scared some of my family are going to be pro-Israel and I just don\u2019t know how to handle it.  I\u2019m not a great debater by any stretch of the imagination nor is my partner (though she is at least really well informed).  \n\n\nTLDR:\nI have some Jewish family member I\u2019ll be seeing for the first time in a long time, but idk their stances on Israel\/palestine and I\u2019m worried about getting into arguments I\u2019m really not that equipped to have.\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell I have pretty bad anxiety lmao.  Basically itwould be awesome if anyone had any tips or thoughts on how to handle a potentially awkward family dinner, maybe change a few peoples minds, or how to deal with potentially having to cut ties with those who I believe to be on the wrong side of history.\n\n\nSorry if you actually  read this garbage haha, but it was kind of therapeutic to ramble.","role":"user"},{"content":"You *can* be forgiven for not making it your war.... it's a terrible, complex, world-politics situation.

The only reason the US Empire prospered is because they swept into vacuum left behind by other colonial empires after the two world wars and inherited their mechanisms of exploitation. \n\nThey can only imagine if the exploitation stops there will be a disaster, but disasters are already happening around them because the exploitation of other countries labour for the gain of capitalists also further exploit local workers who had what little trickle down to them also deprived from them, the only people benefiting are the financial capitalist class and the industrial capitalist in those countries that productive work gets exported to. But why would these empire nobles care? They have already got the bag, as long as their friends in Wall Street and Lockheed Martin don't turn the guns on them they're good!\n\nAnd the US is using every bit of its great power standing and intelligence apparatus to maintain this situation, every country that clamps down or put limits on the capitalists' undertakings in their country gets subverted, couped and demonized. When it happens to a country small enough they don't ever get reported on the news! \n\nWhen China opened up to trade the US thought they had finally had their way. But it turns out the CPC was smarter than that, they allowed the capitalists to bring in the tech and production methods but put them on a leash, when the capitalists get an inch and want a mile, they yank that leash. And so the US restarted demonizing China again when they can, only stopping when they had to shift gears to the middle east for another bloody empire project to defend their petrodollar status after 2000. All the way we have analysts in the empire core telling us how frustrating that makes them they can't focus on subverting China, even while they have simultanously pushed for NATO expansion towards Russia and finally got Putin to finally snap and attack!\n\nCapitalism, especially it final form as international finance Capitalism is a death cult. It leeches blood from workers everywhere, must continuously grow or be out-competed from within, and thus must endlessly expand into new frontiers until they cannot, when no new blood can reach it because every exploited worker can no longer participate in the economy and consume, they will enter a dying state, panic, and try to use other forms of violence to squeeze the last drop of blood from a stone, which is what we see in the rise of Lockheed Martin stock prices after Israel suddenly decided a five front war is a great idea. People fear for fascism arriving in the US just doesn't understand it is already fucking there, and both partys are wings of the eagle on the SS badge.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"I disagree with you that that\u2019s the only reason the US Empire became dominant.\n\nThe US was actually a major imperial power before World War II and in retrospect definitely the strongest nation on earth prior to World War II.\n\nThe us became the largest economy in the world in the 1890s.\n\n\"The United States has been the world's largest national economy in terms of GDP since around 1890.\"\n\n\nhttps:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Economy_of_the_United_States#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20has%20been,of%20GDP%20since%20around%201890.\n\n\nIf geopolitics was a video game the US just has amazing RnG.\n\nIt has vast natural resources. \n\nIt is a continent size Nation where the majority of land is usable \n\n\nEg. Canada and Russia are larger territorially but a lot of their landmass is not usable. \n\nChina is comparable in land size of the United States but the Gobi desert is basically unusable. China is not nearly as Lucky in terms of natural resources. They didn't have as much RnG luck as the United States.\n\n\nThe US has a unique combination of natural resources that would have allowed any nation-state to become the most powerful nation state on Earth with even incompetent leadership. \n\nIt has some of the most fertile ground for agriculture on the planet.\n\nIt has an abundance of everything you need to industrialize and has tons of energy resources. (Oil, natural gas, unconventional gas, coal, etc)\n\nIt has a massive population to draw upon. \n\nFor generations the US has brain drained the rest of the world and gotten a lot of technological progress out of it.  Eg. Nikolai Tesla immigrated to the United States. \n\nIt's completely isolated on the planet and has no realistic rivals in its geographic region. \n\n\nEg. Compared to China who has tons of regional issues. \n\nTerritorial disputes with Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam, and India just off the top of my head. \n\nThere are also simmering issues that Chinese nationalists care about but that the government has abandoned in regards to Russian territory. \n\nThere are just no powerful countries near the United States.\n\n\nIt's like the United States is playing civilization with cheat codes.","role":"user"}]}

The university in question pursues a critical policy towards the Netanyahu government, outgoing rector Herman Van Goethem defends the decision.\n\nUniversities in our country have been in knots over their collaborations with Israeli universities for some time, following the escalation of the Gaza conflict. **The issue already led to a lot of student protests and even occupations of university buildings. Ghent University eventually decided to cut almost all ties with Israeli research institutions, in Antwerp the decision was more restrained**. Thus, a human rights test is applied to ongoing projects, but not all collaborations are immediately terminated. \n\n**Human rights commission gives negative opinion**\n\nRegarding a project with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, **UAntwerpen's human rights committee gave a negative opinion because of \u2018its contributions to Israeli army training programmes\u2019.**\n\nRector Van Goethem says he thinks this is too narrow a basis to stop the cooperation and judges that the university in question must itself be heard. He therefore asks for a reconsideration of the internal advice and submits the matter to the Executive Council.\n\nThe latter body now disregards the negative opinion and decides to continue the cooperation anyway. \u2018A more in-depth risk analysis, complemented by critical consultations with Hebrew University's management, shows that there are no indications of a risk of involvement of this university in serious and\/or systematic human rights violations,\u2019 Van Goethem said.\n\n\u2018Of course, universities are polygamous biotopes, but as a university, Hebrew University pursues policies that are critical of successive Netanyahu governments.\u2019\n\n**New rector Herwig Leirs supports decision**\n\nVan Goethem will be succeeded by Herwig Leirs on 1 September, but in principle that will not change the decision. Leirs says he supports the Executive Council's decision.\n\n\u2018The Israeli army's action in Gaza has horrendous consequences for the civilian population, but the decision on further cooperation with Hebrew University, incidentally in a European research project with several partners from several countries, was taken after thorough discussion based on careful research by the Rector and on current knowledge,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018At the same time, I note that we are not in a position to investigate the activities of a foreign university in even greater depth; this transcends a university as an institution. Further questions can only be answered at a higher level. I am thinking primarily of Europe.\u2019\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http:\/\/DeepL.com) (free version)","role":"assistant"}]}
